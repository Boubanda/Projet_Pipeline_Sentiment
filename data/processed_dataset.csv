i cannot open the app anymore,0
very costly for the premium version approx indian rupees 910 per year better to download the premium version of this app from apkmos website and use it microsoft to do list app is far more better,0
dan birthday oct 28,0
horrible app it doesnt do as described absolutely no support,0
downloaded first thing it trys to do is do a con not impressed,0
no longer works with alexa what happened,0
it doesnt show any list,0
uninstalled it as soon as it started sending me ad notifications why does any developer think this is acceptable disgusting,0
prayer ubde,0
dindigul,0
good,0
frustrating apparently its meant to sync grocery lists with google home but doesnt absolutely no info on how to set it up,0
too complicated to use,0
forced sign in,0
work on it,0
do not for showing or refundrefuse about my persional privacy,0
have to pay for daily reminders my phone does that free,0
the app is amazing  but the vibrations so annoying pls let me turn them off,0
dipak day cox,0
very bad,0
fed up with interruption in each matter i note not worth the while having there are far too many condescending workers out inte cyber world who refuse to take no for an answer,0
was great but cant connect with other people since last update invite will go out and will even receive the invitation but doesnt link and have had no luck with customer support,0
,0
very bad,0
pratz,0
i sent an ivite to people and everyone got over 50 emails for the one invite what a joke of a an app,0
why is this so buggy now why are you no longer really being attentive to quality control cant delete task on one try can no longer delete finished tasks without several attempts all commands are hesitant all commands require multiple attempts i have emailed you 3 times with no response please advise,0
hum hai al ghj,0
shabab,0
makes simple things extremely complicated,0
just use your basic phone calendar,0
i want to cancel the subscription,0
useless app set up 8 reminders during a course of 4 days and not once received any notification waste of money,0
it syncs everything terrible you have to get the pro version in order to be able to do anything actually worth while,0
its a good app but the app keeps crashing when i allow this app to add to my calendar after adding it to calendar then yhis app doesnt open keeps crashing,0
efvig,0
super,0
worked great for a few years and then the past couple of months it eats anything added to the list i can sit and watch things drop off before my very eyes,0
delete application,0
nice app,0

most useless app ever used very difficult to save anything or find anything put some tasks didnt get any reminders so didnt do it erasing this nonsense cant even save this review,0
virenderkumar,0
useless,0
kimhong,0
not making an account,0
sweety sweety kumari,0
please add upi feature because i tried many debit cards to get the premium versionof this app but any of them was accepted,0
lost all my lists when i was forced to give email address was good prior to having to start all over,0
rare,0
whapp integration is bad barely anything works focus to whapp integration and seeya again,0
confused,0
star,0
its ok i guess,0
not what is expected,0
perhaps the least user friendly app on playstore my head is spinning why is it so hard to edit the time of reminder,0
app is good  i am using it since 6 months now but now a days automatically shutdown whole working,0
got into the help menu by accident cant get back to my lists,0
i have bought it yet it displays error in verifying my whatsapp integration ,0
not user friendly,0
useless,0
a mess of features that dont serve me cumbersome ux,0
a suspicious app do not recommend this application,0
weak and underdeveloped platform dont expect support to treat you like a person  this is a company that just wants your money and then to forget about you,0
missing grocery list widget and quantity for grocery list items,0
nested can be improved,0
its a fine app but logs me out every other time i go to use it,0
recurring tasks are behind a pay wall ridiculous to have to pay a monthly subscription for such a simple feature app is a little ugly and not customisable,0
themes and location based reminders are under subscription both are free on most of apps like this thanks but no ill pass and keep using google keep,0
notification is now pathetic shame i liked it a lot i think its time to jump ship its been fun,0
uninstalled after latest update and it blocked all my lists until i set up an account no thanks,0
i dont liek it rlly,0
unable to edit time for reminder s7,0
i want to discontinue and it was monthly base they charge me yearly its very sad pls help and refund,0
no dark theme without a premium subscription ok,0
looks like a copy of an iphone app im not impressed by the huge bar in the bottom or the single colored ui a night mode should come standard,0
very productive,0
i dont like how it charged me automatically after the free trial without informing me expiry of trial or if i wanted to subscribe to the paid service,0
does this app work without internet connection also,0
gaada waktu kapan harus selesai jadi kurang detail,0
over all good task manager but i do not like misleading and untrue boasts about integration with ms outlook it is possible but only via zappier plus functionality is limited not possible to sync task between this 2apps,0
good until it started wanting money for doing its job,0
downloads the app but package file is invalid error pops up before completing installation,0
there should be a dark mode instead of setting through a premium theme option,0
many times ive put sub tasks on my todo tasks and they just disappear for some reason ive forgotten many things because of this and still hasnt been fixed despite various updates,0
app not bad but very limited unless you pay downloaded this app after reading in the news about its whatsapp integration that is only available if you pay without the paid for aspects this application is like any other generic calender app,0
i havent used they made an effort from there side im a bit of a mess and i need time,0
features are all right it doesnt seem to me like they actually use their own product else the idiosyncrasies would have been ironed out,0
love it great future,0
so nice,0
fantastic,0
too many options and gets too fancy for an app that should just have simple functionality to setup reminders and to do items,0
reporting abuse,0
good,0
i like it true,0
hyyy,0
any do moments are not working for me  please look into it,0
dont know,0
it went from simple and useful to cool and confusing this morning i dont know what is going on im disturbed,0
we need a monthly payment terms currently it is yearly only,0
mobile app isnt very intuitive but the desktop app is good,0
the day ended and i didnt end my task and it didnt shift or alarm about undone tasks,0
it had a peculiar issue i have set it up to remind me of my ask with on screen notification but often it fails to do so and then i miss the task,0
this is so frustrating i set a event for someones birthday then a event a month ago before the birthday to not forget to buy the stuff they want and nothing shows up nvm it shows up on my google calendar,0
not pleased,0
dont like the app and trying to unsubscribe but there is no option,0
cant importsync w google tasks,0
its ok,0
cant move it to sd card i need space on my phone so ill likely be deleting it,0
review more for 5 stars,0
ok,0
nice,0
very handy if youre going shopping or need reminders on what you want to purchase easy to use and plenty of features,0
i really like this apps cos it allows me to plan weekly schdules which is very important to me,0

imedwin m gonzalesadmin,0

i am using it daily,1
i really enjoy using the app but i want to suggest a daily summary of tasks to be done in the morning and tasks completed and those that were not thanks for your hard work,1
i dont like that ths deleted or finished every day just let the incomplete ones roll over and the completed ones stay back,1
a good app to remind me of things i need to do,1
gr8,1

good,1
decent app,1
app parfaite si vous voulez vous tenir à jour et savoir où vous en êtes avec vos tâchesmissions versions gratuite avec quelques publicités mais rien de vraiment méchant a tester absolument ,1
anydo moment new colored style isnt good,1
this app was great a year or two ago they spam you now with premium service purchase requests which are costly and have restricted all the good options to their premium service,1

awesome,1
reminder isnt part of standard app needs upgrade,0
reminders are a premium feature you have to pay for this should be basic,0
i was super happy to download this app but that i soon realized that you have to pay for an alarm so that you get notified for your todo list,0
not good,0
why do i have to create an account and sign in for a simple to do app hella sus,0
no reminder options for free version of this app how can one purchase without having the opportunity basic experience of what such app is really needed for my alarm clock would be better than this app sorry i dont recommend,0
lack of reminder in free version,0
i dont liked becous it is not have the time in my tasks day ,0
i will increase one star each day it will help me achieve my goals,0
why is alarm feature premium its the most basic utility someone expects from a todo app,0
requires sign in lol no,0
this app is a joke they want you to pay for simple feature like reminder whats the purpose of free app then make it all paid,0
no reminder alert for free version,0
why the heck do i need to log in with my credentials for this app what dev you guys think i need to keep a record of what tasks i completed earlier in life and i will be very happy to do that ridiculous uninstalled just needed a to do list app as simple as that,0
 notifications ,0
not so great app apart from its natural language input only recently added kanban view but lacks any basic requirements like reminders in the free version also the android widget hangs almost always never gets updated,0
very bad app does not work,0
all functionality comes with premium account only shud have more flexibility for those who are looking for free version,0
ridiculously complicated,0
spam,0
worst most useless app ive had the misfortune to try literally zero point in having this over google calendar dont waste your space its useless you cant have recurring tasks everything is behind a pay wall avoid,0
everything was a purchase immediately after downloading bummer,0
too expensive ticktick is better,0
too complicated and not well organized,0
it started to send emails asking me to add go running or make coffeei wanted a todo list that i could share with my wifenot another wife telling what i should be doing,0
great app but the fact i cant see my recurring tasks for example for the whole month to know if im free on specific day in the future insteas i need to check week by week is a deal breaker although i did pay for the premium and this feature is not avalible will give 5 stars if this important feature is in the app,0
it is the worst app in my life ,0
not as good compared to other apps not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features,0
1,0
everything is a premium feature everything else is a basic list,0
worst only useful when you are using premium,0
you need to subscrib the app to use it they make alot of thing lock and to unlock it you need to subscrib ,0
not really usefull too difficult to use,0
bad reviews are a real turn off for me,0
what good is a task management app if it cannot give reminders,0
without paid membership there was no use of this app so guys dont download it,0
poor support response or lack thereof you cant fully delete a history so i had to create a new account been waiting 12 days for support to transfer my licence over have followed up and still no response very disappointing ref no 507634,0
reminders are a premium feature in a todo app really,0
every thing is for premium users,0
without premium features its just garbage what have kept you guys from removing the free version from play store,0
way too expensive for the premium features while i dont mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track todo items for far less money,0

i need to pay just to use reminder damn never using this app again so money hungry,0
no reminder option why u showcase it in ad when its a paid service,0
have to pay 4mo if you want the reminders to work i have add the reminders are the 1 thing i need in a todo list,0
you create good think bt every option you when i use just close it and subscription to much price 350 par month os is really,0
i dont need my card to set the reminder,0
it is impossible uninstall this one,0
reminders is a paid feature what a joke,0
reminders feature behind in app purchase seriously thats the most basic function of to do list no way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders,0
subscription for reminders 5 well its fine i will move to google tasks,0
worst,0
basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade and it costs 3200 rupees in india thats how much we pay for an entire years electricity bill or groceries for a whole month way too expensive for such basic features nkt worth it useless app,0
too hard to use no tutorials make it worse,0
anything beyond keeping a simple list including reminders is paid,0
baad,0
many features are available just for premium,0
garbage,0
time reminder available to to premium only  really   pretty desperate to earn some bucks ,0
reminders are behind a paywall,0
boring,0
pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost 4  55 monthly immediately uninstalled ill stick to anydo for now premium is almost halfprice,0
everything included in premium feature  only frame work is there,0
no notification on free version ,0
basic features like comments and tags are behind a subscription wall,0
an outright scam for absolutely any basic functionality they are going to charge and everything you add will incur extra charges just a get rich quick scam by a couple of cheats,0
free or trail version has nothing you cant set a reminder for your tasks,0
everything behind a pay wall,0
everything is premium ,0
anything that calls itself a to do list that doesnt include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless uninstalled,0
good,0
mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create disappointed with to this app,0
i will use other app i will not pay,0
in basic app why cant even add comment its not even basic when it comes to free,0
36 per year for push notification reminders no thanks,0
requires my email no thanks,0
pay to remind really,0
total waste of money,0
not convenient for users,0
reminder is under premium seriously must need unstall,0
not helpful,0
no reminders in free version and pro version is very costly they should lower their prices according to ppp todo list without reminders is useless i can use any notepad app instead of free version of todoist,0
everything was great until i wanted to send a push notification reminder for a task and you tried to get me to pay for it a simple push notification and you want me to pay for it,0
reminder is chargeable service  no point,0
most of its premium,0
that app is good but i could not benifit,0
almost no productivity without premium version,0
everything is premium,0
paywall heavy,0
i realy didnt like titack is better to me,0
cost,0
you need to pay to add reminderalarm which should be a basic feature,0
did i read that right to add reminders to my tasks will cost me 36 per year are you crazy,0
only for singlr use cant assign task and sub task to others,0
y,0
not flexible enough for my needs,0
so you tell me to pay every month for same functionality in premium no still doing normal in everything else,0
why would i pay for this app for reminders its just a goddamn simple feature,0
subscription required just to set a reminder,0
why you gotta pay for push notifications or reminders at a certain point you guys are just a company trying to get rich,0
there are better options available i just didnt like the layout and functionality of the app i tried it for a couple of months but now its deleted and i am going to try another,0
reminder requires payment,0
expensive,0
i was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature i uninstalled would have been great otherwise,0
not very user friendly,0
yeah keep everything for premium and then say its free,0
i wish there would be a widget on lockscreen,0
گزینه آندو ش میپره,0
to many features locked behind premium,0
gud,0
why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date can this be fixed,0
versão free não faz quase nada quase enganação falar que o app é gratuito,0
you cant have your to do list as notifications,0
it just feel old,0
almost every feature requires a premium account for 36 per year its not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan,0
you have to upgrade to get notifications,0
tedious and annoying to use went back to using google keep,0
cant make into my calendar,0
use google tasks instead,0
too many premium features,0
should tell the cost first,0
lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget i use todoist for homework assignments and i used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for without being able to see all my parentsub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app i went back to an old apk but then i started getting prompts that the app would stop working if i didnt update i still use it as a grocery list with ifttt until keep is fixed,0
doesnt even come close to wunderlist or anydo unless you pay,0
need to learn more,0
have to pay for labels theres no separate sections for different categories on widget,0
very simple design that makes adding a task complex also most useful features are premium,0
where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 25 years and this app never worked properly for me i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess businesslinehalit try searching your emails i wrote more details in original post,0
wunderlist is much better,0
it works but way too expense and compkicated than most user will need this free version has too many pieces missing and is just frustrating,0
mahal harus bayar mahal untuk bisa mendapatkan fitur2 penting,0
really liked this app until they started charging for basic functions on a monthly basiswould have been happy with one time charge but not worth 36 a year when there is better for less,0
the free version is very limited,0
reminder is a premium feature really the app isnt user friendly,0
its an average app to waste time on and increasing your work,0
looks good until you have to pay 3month to add labels,0
free features are much better in wunderlist app and second best would be anydo,0
the free version has a minimal functionality there more advanced free apps on the playstore,0
the chrome extension is awesome but not the mobile app,0
limited features with the trailfree version ,0
premium or nothing,0
puts basic functionality such as setting notfications behind a paywall you have to pay monthly or yearly,0
you cant do almost anything without upgrading to premium,0
there is better google keep than this if you need a free one you need to pay to use this,0
يحتاج بال رايق و معقد مو مثل ما اتوقعت وقت ثاني يمكن احمله,0
full power app sometimes a task gets shuffled on its own otherwise amazing,0
it felt like too much,0
the free tier is close to useless and coming from ticktick i found todoist pricier and work fewer features,0
app is great as a wunderlist replacement but subscibing to get push notifications with a ridiculus amount of money it is not possible unfortunately i wont use this app,0
ok i waited a long time for this app to run in landscape mode on my tablet no dice reducing to 3 starts until this functionality is added sorry but i cant use this app 50 of the time thanks,0
why arent reminders free ,0
nc,0
its a nice app but to keep in mind your tasks it needs a notification but u have to pay for it thats what i hate in this app coz it doesnt remind u that at what time u have to do a task it gets a little boring while this  sometimes i forget about my tasks,0
not that great,0
reminders and some other features should have been free,0
базовый функционал платный,0
not bad but the best features of this app is contain credit,0
it reminds and keep systematic record of daily work,0
i like it,0
good,0
too many clicks to do things you need premium version for reminders,0
feedback,0
why too many steps to remove a project,0
simple clear unobstrusive but alignment and form of edited note does not mirror that of the saved note in the task list view,0
charging every task,0
an app that makes you pay for something for a feature as trivial as reminders cannot be considered as an usable free app,0
good,0
not bad,0
still trying it out,0
good,0
shouldnt have to pay for reminders,0
reasonably decent todo list but the yearly fee is too high for what this product actually provides,0
ok not as easy to add a project after task has been entered a little clunky moving task to next day,0
more steps to go through to access lists that were immediately available on wunderlist,0
mainly making use of tasks the sub tasks within make my day,0
need notes option like wunderlist has get that and youll get a 5 star i have the premium version and we want notes aswell as the chat please just like wunderlist,0
nice app,0
its pretty good so far im still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps,0
please add app option to put new task at the top of the list for those that are coming from wunderlist,0
reminders should be available for all,0
new to the app so still learning,0
nice app but would like access to a calendar without paying premium price,0
would be awesome if paid but free version too restricted it aint worth it,0
useful,0
having some problems figuring out what all this app offers still learning it,0
widget non responsive suddenly u want to tick one item a whole lot of other items tht got clicked,0
repeating previous posts dont bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium its just a shell not worth the space it requires,0
i wish more options be available to free version,0
app is good to use but its premium so not using now,0
great way to start to get organized,0
frustrating update plans,0
,0
keeps me focused but i dont want to purchase anything i think it could all be free in my opinion,0
looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to i would reconsider if the paywall wasnt a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase,0
great app,0
phone samsung galaxy j7 star i just started using the app ill upgrade or downgrade accordingly,0
good,0
not user friendly free version very limited,0
will this be available for computers soon,1
excellent,1
it is a great app id give it 4 12 stars if i could my only problem with this is that the premium has you pay for something simple as notifications,1
this app helps me alot in tracking and managing my different jobs,1
this is really helping me be organized,1
me esta gustando el sistema que usa,1
simple and intuitive,1
the last update is a win the new karma  productivity interface are top notch keep improving this already awesome app for eventually reaching the perfection update love the new black theme this thing is beautiful keep it up,1

amazing,1
really love the app as it keep me on time and improved my productivity too,1
it helps me keep up with daily chores having the reminder emails is a plus,1
good for tasks,1
simple intuitive effective,1
basic functions work all well good ui and sectionings of works will get you through the basic needs,1
i like that everything i need to do is right in one app with a reminder loving it it also allows lists withing the list you are making,1
pls add week days option when repetitive tasks are added i dont want to do them on sundays but still it notifies me,1
pretty good so far,1
good if u are a to do list person,1
okey,1
its lived up to what it say it would do,1
i think an added calendar feature would make this app perfect i find myself constantly going back and forth between todoist and google calendar to schedule my stuff all in all a great app though,1
its better to put more options for notifications actually the best notifiaction options is for samsung reminder,1
i like it but i do wish they could have alarms or reminders or something,1
making a list is not something i find easy but todoist is making it happen,1
best app ever but we cant resort task from widget  plz add this feature tnx alot,1
works great,1
pretty cool app the best for to list or management ive ever used,1
better than all the other dozen other similar apps ive tried,1
good list app simple to use,1
so far good need to check for addons,1
it was a gud experience and i found it useful to plan my exam schedule priorities,1
enjoying offloading from my head and the app telling me what ive scheduled from the day great for busy minds,1
not perfect but so far my favorite to do app,1
keep a track of your grocery list or your daily goals or be on track for your long term project this app will definitely help you in all the ways it can great for increasing productivity,1
i appreciate the reminders,1
found usefull,1
id like to see a list of the tasks ive done in the last 30 days,1

helps me reminder the important tasks to do,1
i am still testing it efficiency,1
awesome to do and project management would revommend also i hope to get the premium soon,1
420420 amazing app that beats my lame ass planner,1
a really simple and effect app however you really need to upgrade to premium to get the most out of it,1
reminder is a paid feature and the premium version is too costly,1
free version is missing some bells and whistles but overall gets the job done,1
so far this app has been very helpful i will be trying out the premium version very soon once i do i will update this review,1
the handling is very fast and intuitive,1
works great,1
nice app to keep me focused,1

32780 weather 666iu778 is a kitten 27gh with q many different 87878how 1,1
great so far after a few days free trial,1
great app does things easily maybe a video of effective usage would help,1
this is the best why i give this 4 star because you need to be in premium to use the alarm thing,1
great for getting reminded of your tasks,1

not advisable and reliable highly complicated,0
i paid so muchcan you remove the subtaskis annoyinglagginghangnot the best anymoreextremely dissapointedworse and worsepleasepleasedo a new update,0
i paid for this yesterday and i got my premium only for one day today im not premium again i had enough disappointment because my 2nd device didnt get premium after i paid and now my first device also like this i emailed you since yesterday and also write on feedback on app but i got no reply,0
i am a premium subscriber for 2 months i billed for october but my premium expired and app support is not replying to my emails,0
so much features require to pay to use evil money hungry developer,0
garbage,0
how do you sync this is next to worthless unless you can sync,0
complicated mess,0
to view your calendar you have to sign up  then after you sign up it say you have to upgrade  by upgrade they mean buy it for a month subscription or pay for a year  cant really use it for its intended purpose without having to buy it i downloaded it because i was under the assumption that its basic functioning was free the subscription price is cheap but im careful which places i put my bankcard info as i dont feel comfortable putting any info about myself out there,0
terrible support i purchased the yearly suscription and i got no answer using the feedback  suggestion from the app and neither using mail to get a refund scam,0
fewer integration with google account,0
good app,0
nice,0
price not shown before creating an account,0
the tasks doesnt show up on time and it always overdue and i dont get to finish my important tasks i have to find another one  to do list app this app sucks,0
270 per month for a to do list app are you serious i would mind an add banner at all and would find it fare i know you guys arent volunteers but guys dont think that i am as desperate enough as to pay such a fee for to do lists,0
expensive,0
chinese app,0
too many errors,0
the premium version of the app is goodbut the free version is useless and some school students dont get proper support paying monthly from their family of my country every interesting and useful feature arw in premium,0
i bought the full version of gtasks pro from this company and now its unavailable think twice before buying from them,0
i dont like this app becauseno protecting from this app,0
reminders doesnt work,0
i dont like this app,0
automatic synchronisation disabled by developers ,0
worst,0
do not work on time,0
its chinese so fear of data security issues uninstalled it,0
this is the beat app of all ,0
i downloaded this app after hearing good things about it i had todoist and my subscription ended and i wanted to try this i downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist after entering everything i uninstallled todoist bad idea i decided to upgrade ticktick to premium once i upgraded they asked me to sign in which i did upon signing in it deleted all the items i had in the app already contacted support havent heard back from then yet what a way to thank me for upgrading,0
it just vibrate i never get an alert it only list the task and vibrate when i open the app it doesnt alert me,0
annoys user to rate the app heres your one star,0
unable to login in all login options it says sign in failed check nw but nw is fineam able to access internet,0
boycott chinese products shame on chinese president,0
waste of time,0
the majority of things are blocked off by subscription,0
i didnt like it premium for month view really ,0
earlier this app was working fine but now frequently missing to remind task on set time,0
this app doesnt work the way we wont it doesnt notify after even permitting it,0
it wont let me remove my subscription,0
bad and have ads,0
i dont like this,0
the application looks nice and simple but the synchronization between mobile and desktop version is awful a lot of pictures from tasks which were added via desktop version are not accessible on mobile and vise versa,0
some of the crucial features are premium only,0
i can not change my font size,0
run from this horrible app i wasted three days trying to get it to work duplicates list when importing app charged me over 15000 worst customer service this is a terrible app does not work total rip off,0
useful function require paid membership doesnt solve the purpose,0
it doesnt work ,0
free version only allows 9 lists lame,0
cant even understand how to use itdidnt like at all,0
i keep adding tasks its nit showing on widget very complicated to use,0
not good app all u need buy and clock facility not given,0
the reminders do not work,0
widget has stopped working and the developer is unresponsive,0
new update has performance bug very slow in scrolling down and typing update after last update now i cannot type or write anything in task description after markdown features ,0
awesome,0
um you need to pay for the duration of the task no thanks i will just find a new app,0
no pomo time more than 1hr no whitelist available no feature for tracking task progress also add the feature to quit bad habits,0
not good looking and hard to manage tasks,0
i absolutely adored this app until the most recent update the task nesting feature is far too sensitive and becoming a real nuisance i emailed the developers about this issue a week ago and sadly received no response ill be cancelling my subscription until this issue is rectified,0
the alarm is delayed  its not working anymore,0
really clean and seems to have a lot of good features but i got this app specifically to make grocery shopping lists to share with my husband i have sent him the collaboration invite multiple times and the list has not appeared in his app the collab feature goes not appear to work,0
i cant use it because i must to pay and be premium that rude ,0
loved it until the last update now the widgets dont show just a blank white block that says problemloading widget please fix,0
tick tock plaece,0
there is a limit to the attachments that can be madenot a substitute for wunderlist,0
ugly all white ui themes make almost no difference no option to keep completed tasks in list sync is unreliable and does not even notify the user when unsuccessful service is down right now per their twitter but app shows no errors sync simply doesnt work web ui is extremely bloated and runs an unacceptable amount of client side scripts still better than the new google tasks though,0
great task app but it will auto reformat your typing and you cant stop it  this is a huge problem,0
ehnot great for an expensive app one of my important tasks went missing i asked for help but response hasnt produced the lost task yet,0
nur 9 listen erlaubt in kostenlose version,0
thought the ui was clunky and unintuitive i bought their premium based on an mkbhd video  i will be cancelling today,0
all basic features are paid and the free features are very limitedvery disappointing,0
it wasnt enough good because lots of its features was unavailable,0
limit of 9 lists total are you kidding,0
devs tried to send me a link in the review comments which i cant even copy let alone open from my phone because their apps is too unintuitive to use without a manual,0
premium version only,0
good,0
برنامه ی خیلی خوبیه از همشون بهترهولی جا داره ک بهترم بشه,0
didnt like that to really use it as a planner i had to upgrade,0
having issues with syncing with google calendar i added a task on ticktick and its been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my google calendar ive tried refreshing but nothing showed up ive looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now i just purchased the pro and its not worth it if it doesnt sync,0
night mode doesnt show up under theme,0
reminder is not working in realme phone i did all the settings in my phone and app settings but still not working,0
not backup in device offline ,0
now when i get a reminder it wakes up the screen to display the notification theres no way to change this edit reminder popups is already switch off,0
the free version is garbage compared to anydo every other click pops up premium warning and its annoying as hell,0
best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire they only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if i open any other app old standard android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until i dealt with it  far superior please bring that back,0
this is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me i found a free app that does tbe same things,0
i wouldve switched to ticktick but there is no option to change to a 12 hour setting from a 24 hour ,0
when i share my task on whatsapp even though i selected share title and content it only shares title version  522  if i share my task in the form of image the task with long name the end of the name gets replaced with  instead of showing the remaining heading on new line,0
loved this app until it stopped syncing my android app and web app have been out of sync for over 2 weeks,0
all the main options are charged then why list the app for free might as well list it as charged app,0
tutorial ,0
great app but isnt optimized for google pixel 3xl i cant resize the widget to match the size of the screen,0
nada es gratis,0
no android wear app,0
i purchased the app all i need now is to add color to the calendar entries mmh ill think of some stuff later,0
the app is a little confusing in the way it works and it is a little ridiculous to pay 3 a month just to see a calendar,0
app seems ok but they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar it lets you view the current week anything else and you have to pay so many free ones out there to choose from uninstalling,0
i wish there was a one time payment option and a dark mode i cant add another subscription to the msny i already have,0
its just a simple to do list  why did you locked some tools ,0
came back to this after not using it for a while tonnes of updates has made it rubbish,0
premium is very expensive,0
the features are good but unfair to pay on yearly basis,0
task management is terrible it will kill the apps running to draw over the screen frequently my camera shuts off because tick tick notification,0
the features that were used to convince me to install all require premium access will not buy something with so little real use testing,0
add option remind at specific location instead of time only if this is already there can you please educate me how to use that,0
its good if youre willing to spend so much money how annoying,0
i hate when you say that its such a great app and i download it only to find out that you only get the bare basics for something that is advised as free i could only view one week and the rest of the features were extremely limited as well waste of time,0
if the upgrade free its well was best,0
tiktik was the best but the last 2 version is not good at all the text of havit prompt is very large although i set the text in small and recently the remainder time is showing in the notification panel as an alerm icon of the default alerm apps icon  please fix it,0
所提供的功能都很不錯但uiux還需加強希望能簡化一些設置步驟,0
hi a,0
it is awsome if you know how to control it,0
the free version does just about enough for my requirements but no more limited sharing and reminders are less than generous but it works well enough,0
i dont know why the stick notifications not working i have been checked my all settings but i could not find whats the problem,0
sync could use real work needs a manual option for when working with multiple devices other cloud services can be seen to work immediately on a second device theres zero settings for synchronization,0
tick tick should also inform us about the clashes when two things are scheduled at the same time,0
not as smooth as i hoped,0
best app pls allow to add upto 10 habits in free version ,0
nice app,0
a call reminder feature is absolutely needed,0
its a good app for reminders,0
sometimes dont show reminders,0
ok,0
no doubt this app is amazing and this app deserve 5 star but i am frustrated because this app doesnt keep log more than 90 days i wish it could kept forever,0
the app is not compatible to read my notifications on my wrist bandall other apps notifications do workall settings are set on my phone to make sure i receive the notifications but in vainplease make an update for thisany update on this issue please,0
lately from past two days i am facing difficulty using widget getting an error task list not found whenever i strike off a task please look into it asap,0
no transparent theme,0
only the premium version is good,0
widget is slow,0
its ok a bit messy,0
too much options getting me confused and more complexity,0
this app certainly has some really great features which others competitiors dont clearly have potential to be the best in the market cons  sync issues time to load up in windows 10 bugs in habit tracker  tasks,0
i cannot login to the app,0
only allowed 9 lists for free need to purchase for additional listssuch a bummer wunderlist was much better but i had to switch over as they closed tick tick is not so straightforward to sync with another user,0
monthly widget needs to be premium,0
3,1
why not find arabic language,0
ok but its not different as my phones app,0
the statistics show i missed everything in a day even though i completed 90 of the tasks,0
good,0
decent todo app for single user home screen widget does not receive remote updates,0
you need to make a clear all data or reset everything button i had to delete my account because it triple synced and i wanted all this mess gone and i couldnt please consider it,0
this is good app,0
i was little starting to be comfortable comparing to other appunless the premium came up i dont any personal ac to pay just to get reminded where multiple remider doesnt worki literally start loving and hate at the same timeu cant get multiple unless u get premium this aint my app,0
thanks for this apps its fells great,0
i have just started using this app and it looks great  except for the drop down menu from the 3 dots which doesnt show the full menu and you cannot scroll down in it either please fix this,0
need some options and need to be more organaise,0
please make a more sleek widget please,0
i cant scroll the widget or other screens ill probably subscribe if this gets reliably fixed since wunderlist is dead now,0
unnecessarily complex a simple one dimensional version would be fine,0
its good but its size is large,0
jus started using so far i like it,0
just upgraded to premium version app and google play list subscription at 2799 i got charged 2984 ,0
nice one,0
it could have been a robust app but these bunch of loosers want you to pay every month is annoying,0
i have the premium version i had been using wunderlist the most amazing todo app ever and very intuitive tick tick has worked well as wunderlist is no longer supported however some key things i truly miss push notifications when someone texts within the app notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list copy and paste everything i need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list,0
experiência muito boa mas tem muito a ser feito,0
good as it is simple and effective it could be more enhanced,0
you have to subscribe for the pro version id rather just have one flat fee,0
too many items,0
i would buy if there was onetime only purchase i cant pay monthly and its still enough to use without premium but i want premium and one time purchase ,0
amazing,1
very helpfull does a very good job when typing an action or notes its very slow on an lg smartwine phone,1
самое лучшее приложений для управления задачами но ограничение в 99 задач в списке  это полная глупость,1
its very useful but i hope becoming free,1
very good app,1
its a good app i do use it alot but there are problems with it like if you put 2 or more reminders in a habit the notification wont work and my other problem is with the premium if you have money you can have better features and during these times you would prefer to save up but the app is great i do recommend it,1
i think its a good app,1
multifunction app that help you remember everything and anything and force you to be more productive,1
well performing,1
good but no have arabic language,1
its been amazing to use tick tick,1
if only it had a dark splash screen i have set the dark theme in the app to keep it easy on my eyes at night but that bright splash screen just ruins it i know that googles apps do the same thing and its absolutely stupid,1
best,1
it will be nice if the week calender view open in free,1
great app but why not improve sync function on wear os i have to buy another todo app only because it has better support on wear os so please improve it and make me only pay for this app,1
its good for handling,1
great app,1
cool apps,1
nice app you can organize tour day you will not forget things anymore,1
not to be confused with tiktok a clearly inferior alternative,1
i wish it would give mote puch and be little more user friendly altogether a great app,1
nice app,1
notes are great idea but without endtoend encryption they are useless to me,1
i use this app all the time with great benefit 4 stars instead of 5 because of crappy support when i had a technical problem with the app,1
functional features are very simple and effective to use not combersome great job,1
very nice app ben using it for years,1
it has the most qualities i want in an app like this,1
this is the first time im sticking with a todo list kind of app so far so good,1
great app life is so much easier only thing missing is a public api and support for automated backups please let me own my data,1
great way to prioritize,1
app is great especially pomodoro modecan u include a click to count the no of time taken to study in a day etc along with that,1
love the design of app please provide export options reason for not giving 5 ,1
great,1
good so far,1
nice app,1
best task app out there only thing its missing is 2fa to keep accounts safe,1
تطبيق قائمة مهام ممتازة للأمانة  وايضا يقدم داخل التطبيق تقويم وايضا هناك اداة لصنع عادات  ولكن كل الميزات ومن ضمنها قائمة المهام والتقويم وساعة التركيز يمكن الحصول عليها من تطبيقات اخرى لدي  لذا سأفضلها على هذا التطبيق,1
it helps to do tha things in better way  ,1
my life has officially been put together,1
nice app as i wanted,1
best planner app theres more to it than any simple work planner app highly customisable and easy to use,1
good,1
請問繁體中文什麼時候才能支援農曆真的很喜歡這個 app 也訂閱好幾年了但一直有這個缺點,1
nice app best planner in play store good app for busy people,1
the pomo in the ticktick website doesnt register the pomos i cant seem to see any pomos from when im using the website in the pomo stats section in the app,1
alhamdulillah it is a nice app but its reminding timer is not accurate most of the time it doesnt work on time please fix it thanks,1
would have loved to give it 5 stars but the alarm does not works properly sometimes changed all required settings but it still misses some alarms other than that its the best to do list app i have ever seen and the pomodoro is just awesome,1
نمیشه برای صفحه رنگی انتخاب کرد برای همین یه ستاره کم کردم وگرنه خیلی خوبه,1
pomos dont vibrate my phone,1
this is nice app,1
its amazing ok i was really happy with the ability to create list and then a task and furthermore a subtask with a customizable reminder for each however the problem start there when you turn off the popup notification and only rely on the regular notification panel it just shows the the subtask name with no additional infos of the main task or the list not even the tag or the customized color is included with it i really sometimes find it difficult to identify the subtask hopefully you fix it,1
,1
nice,1
nice experience,1
setting periodic tasks is hard to get used to,1
bulk voice sms broadcaster improvement this feature in your aap plsss,1
actually like the new pomodoro statistics update but the bar chart has a flaw i cant see the exact number of hours but rather an estimate because the exact hours arent written onto the days like they were before itd be great if you could fix that otherwise love it,1
it is truly amazing app for productivity i wish to give 5 star but many features are not available in the free version thats the reason im giving 4star,1
so far it does what i need,1
for habits statistics please add graphics of weeks and months progression,1
good,1
great app  could you please add the option to view habits on the tommorow list,1
achchha app hai magar kabhi kabhi dikkat aati hai usse fix karna jaruri hai,1
some lag in sync but otherwise good,1
pretty good good app does what i need it to do,1
routine tasks if not finished are shown as an overdue please give an option to auto mark any specific routine tasks as incomplete rather than overdue,1
works great i enjoy having it available on my phone and on my work computer,1
that is really useful for me i can use it for many plan and to do things and doing chores and   if u can add note for writing notes and  and something like goal planner and program manager it will be more useful than now tnx,1
its amazing apart from the fact that it reminds me of you events from yesterday,1
it is need to support arabic language,1
pretty good app helps get things done easy to use no issues yet,1
pretty good,1
this app was really good so far this is the best app i used to stay on track but i hate it when i need to pay for premium please make it free,1
terimakasih sudah membantu,1
easy n accurateuser friendly app voice to text funtion is also very helpful,1
some things should be made easier like typing in the tasks one after the other easily without having to press save and new everytime,1
helps me accomplish my tasks,1
this app has all the features and customisation required in a task mgmt app and the developer is proactive  what freaks me is doubts about data security as the company is based out of hong kong,1
pretty good some bugs,1
good,1
so simple and user friendly,1
godd,1
very good,1
so far so good,1
good app to keep track of the todo list,1
it is a fun appp,1
a very cool program we want arabic,1
ok,1
does this app have auto sync with google account,1
this works very well awesome app,1
i loved the app so much  it is amazing and helps me a lot organize my ideas i think if it had the option to put our tasks in order and the option of setting timer it would be very organized and irreplaceable,1
good but some more ease is needed,1
the widget is quite imlressive,1
just what i needed would give 5 if it had time tracker,1
i definitely recommend it,1
good,1
nice app,1
its user friendly love using it,1
like this app it had everything i expected a todo list to do so i have no complaints,1
it gives notification on time which mostly apps dont give,1
good,1
nice,1
love this app would like to say thanks for creating this app three star only because calendar is bit buggy one is there are no real time syncing with google calendar which force me to use tickticks calendar which is not convenient for me,1
good fun  motivated,1
great app and experience all the features are great,1
its really good app i have been using it for few days really helpful just one thing when i add a new task it shows up on the top of existing tasks can i change the settings so that it will appear at the bottom thats why given 4 stars,1
good,1
i really like it the reason im giving a 4 star is that i wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins 120 mins means ive got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus ps im using the free version i dont know whether it available on the premium version or not,1
it is a nice app and really helps me manage my tasks especially study tasksit should also include features like sharing schedule with friends ,1
this app is great really nice for organizing stuff only thing i miss is a monthly overview with statistics,1
really nice but need some more changes,1
i love this app only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesnt dismiss notifications on the others ,1
good but is there a one time fee for this thing i abhor having to pay 299month vs just paying a one time fee,1
very good app for time management,1
excellent app,1
tick tick is good but it should add more ring tones please try,1
good,1
this was a great tick of thing to get i am more organized now insted of just have paper to do lists i got a digital one this great and think every one shound have it tho at times it can get hard to know how to do stuff but later on you get a hang of iti love it,1
it is good but could be so much better with full google assistant integration,1
pretty good does what i need it to do,1
current review please add feature insert picture with task last review awesome,1
optional,1
love how its user friendly on all my devices,1

awesome syncs could be faster though habits take too much time to sync and some completed tasks on the laptop sync very late sending a barrage of unnecessary notifications on the phone or vise versa amazing response time of support and dev teams,1
very nice app,1
very nice and easy,1
thank you next,1
easy to use has really helped me organise and reach my goals i wish there was more customisation options for maybe one off payments rather than monthly for premium but even the nonpremium version is great,1
best todo app,1
the best productivity app of all time,1
ticktick is making me more productive a writen task is done task for me,1
works perfectly and suits my needs,1
voice alret only missing,1
this app doesnt have a background music which makes it not like a game at all no music doesnt make me interested at all put like a doom soundtrack or at least something ,0
this is maybe what radicalizes people into anchroprimitivists,0
too damned complicated to even keep up with a video game hub is more organized and simplified than this,0
i have just downloaded this app and i cant register is there a reason for that,0
unable to download it beyond 78 even as other apps download in a second,0
kept bugging out trying to registerlog in,0
unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in by google account or email i tried a lot from iran,0
mandatory registration,0
installed it and it glitched and didnt display many of the images on the create your avatar page immediately uninstalled,0
please make this app offline as well,0
1,1
great app but only if it was an offline app i wouldve given it a five star please fix this,0
i got completely banned from this app today and i have screenshot from reddits about what happened to the chat in june 11 2019,0
far from what i expected after seeing the pictures,0
this app runs on internet and is not very customizable life rpg is the best out there,0
uninstalled because it wouldnt work offline,0
the big problem is that task management should work offline and habitica should have synchronization feature like anki mobile and anki pc,0
i love it at first plus the very idea gamifying a task to make it a habit it was all fun until the i cant use it offline that really threw me off please make it available offline as well,0
couldnt login,0
i downloaded this app because i thought that the game concept for todo lists would be really cool opened the app just after downloading and tried to register an account and it wouldnt let me log in waited another hour and it still wasnt working call me impatient but i just couldnt use an app that refused to work,0
this app is bullocksi downloaded it and it ran smoothly on my phone and i setup my avatar my habits and my daily task and then it just stopped working and couldnt open the app again,0
have to register,0
i cannot change the order of dailies which is frustrating since normally i would like to have them in chronological order,0
server issues please fix will change review when its fixed,0
it doesnt work worked fine first few hours now it keeps saying it cant connect to the server,0
requires being online to use which is a shame because it looks like a fun way to get motivated would use if it didnt require constant network or wifi connection i live and work in rural areas  had to uninstall due to inability to use throughout the day,0
uninstalled couldnt get it to register disappointed,0
need to work offline,0
was expecting it to be offline,0
it doesnt work,0
useless,0
needs online account you want to see our habits eh no thank you,0
cant edit or change anything,0
is not working in my device i cant open it ,0
no good as other applications but good for games and one task or goal like da daily routines work,0
please make it work offline,0
its slow itll be better if it works offline,0
88,0
requires an account,0
not userfriendly,0
its been really helpful for habit building but its now bugging like crazy and crashing every time i open it so not wonderful,0
heres the thing i love this app and the idea behind it but for some reason its so dang glitchy pages wont always change when i scroll tasks dont refresh i often have to completely close the app help very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out,0
this app would be 100x better if it incorporated some of the edittingcustomizing functions of the other todolist apps out there i want to be able to strike through each of the to do items and view deletedarchivedcompleted items be able to choose colors etc ,0
the app is awesome but it made my phone drain 30 battery per day in the background which makes it useless,0
very buggy and doesnt always show whole pages or lists,0
clunky and very slow to load not fun at all  just yet another task i had to deal with daily,0
the app was working fine until it started bugging out recently and showing me the wrong dailies going back to using just the website now until this is fixed,0
the app itself is quite good but without offline mode its useless for me,0
this app seemed very interesting until i got into the app and at the very start of it it made itself very clear that this app is geared towards women the avatar customization part all the hair and accessories were for women app seemed cool but unwelcoming for guys,0
too slow and clunky especially with signup,0
too ugly to be attracted to,0
i couldnt get passed avatar creation due to the app crashing,0
doesnt work,0
aeesome concept but very buggy and laggy wont register my taps in some places it skipped my tutorial because it wouldnt register my taps to continue,0
the bugs are annoying and keep it from being a better app update still has way too many bugs that never get fixed downgrading from 3 to 2 stars,0
the idea is great but the design is cumbersome and counter intuitive i bought gems but was unable to set up challenges due to a bug in the app,0
difficult to use,0
yeah too many bugs,0
this app has a lot of bugs that need to be worked out the ios version is a lot better,0
i keep tapping and its just unresponsive it seems like a fun app but to keep tapping and not getting anywhere is annoying it just stops please fix seems like a fun app to try out,0
great concept but i just cant do quests,0
there are too much connection errors and bugs and they are really annoying please fix it,0
its absolutely fine but can be a bit laggytemperamental,0
missing the integration with egcalendar u have to fill in too many forms and manage it all by yourself,0
nice app although the first sentence of the description of the app isnt nice life shouldnt be treated like a game,0
make it offline then it will best appp,0
terrible ui,0
it is a pretty good concept its just not for me,0
this app seems to make me want to procrastinate more,0
it doesnt work offline and when im actually online i need also a vpn to use it ,0
0,0
please make offline version because most of studious people cannot afford online apps so if you want good ratting please make part 2 offline,0
miss the dark theme,0
too complex as a game the time i spent tried to understanding how it work could have been spent actually working,0
i really enjoyed the experience of using this app i like it but it doesnt work offline so i cant use it properly so please make it offline or at least se fundamental features,0
a great app has some kinks that need ironing and ill update when theyre done but i love this app and use it daily  as intended ,0
3,0
best,0
fun way to track habits it would be great if you could update tasks without an interent connection and then just sync the next time your connected like many other trackers,0
it has great promise but i cant use it offline so its worthless to me,0
timezone feature broken the gamification was a little too complicated and too much for my needs,0
great app and service the user base is amazing and the staff is awesome no notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks cant read the full text of challenge tasks before joining most notifications dont work for me the redesign looks really nice,1
wow adhd helper for sure,1
good but have more levels,1
this app actually made me want to stick to my habits the moneyexp system is kind of broken and arbitrary fun way to think about your habits as life skills and the more you do it the better you get at it,1
it deserves more than 42 id rate it 45 for productivity,1
neat,1
quite confusing,1
this app can save your life love how you can pin widgets to your home screen on android phones only suggestion is to add a calendar,1
great way to manage your tasks only downside is you set the deadlines and can knowingly chance them at any time,1
great app,1
the concept is absolutely amaizing but the procedures are very complex can you plaese make another app with same concept and with simple procedures in simple words please make a simple app which has concept of gaming type rewards on completing important tasks,1
buggy but awesome,1
would be perfect if i could organize the todos by date theyre random right now,1
ill give it a 55 once yall make it functional offline  like maybe allow us to editcross off tasks offline and let it automatically sync once connected to the internet,1
very help,1
i am a big gamer and always found my self more motivated by games thank you for making my life action list more fun and rewarding,1
wonderful app,1
it really helps,1

just love it,1
excellent for daily tasks and scheduling future ones,1
life changing app if you have any affinity to video games and want to better your life youre in the right place this app saved me,1
amazing app one request from the developers this app is turning humans into better humans so the rouge class should be renamed to the ninja or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing itthis pure psychology and this is how low of attraction works never talk or think of things which you dont want in life you yourself would not want anyone to be rouge so please give rouge some positive polish if you can only a humble suggestion,1
awesome it really helps me to level up my life,1
a good app love the concept helped me,1
this is the first time i found an app which can read my mind this app really knows the scientific importance of reward i really advice anyone to install this app and give it a try especially if you are a student,1
it is awesome super helped me but i have a suggestion you can improve your chat session and to invite members to party you can make so we can explore users and invite them,1
ive never enjoyed accountability before this our whole family partied up and is having a blast playing to do chores wonderful concept,1
im really enjoying the fun parts about this game and hope that it continues to grow downside is the glasses and headband cant come off the avatar so my character is stuck with them for awhile,1
super helpful for habits and breaking bad ones,1
loving the app so far just a minor note i cant seem to unequip my avatars glasses or headband,1
awesome,1
this is great after having played it for three days i was begging my mom for chores to do,1
10 out 10 recommend for anyone who wants to stay organized and goal oriented without knowing youre doing it this app is for beginners looking for a concept to start planing or motivating  go getters who want a fun and resourceful way to sort your goals and stay motivated,1
has really helped me get more done and stay on task,1
the best out there,1
i love habitica it works to make the things i have to do at least somewhat rewarding and i can set fun goals for boring tasks,1
fantastic app i have tried many other productivity app and used to find it difficult to follow them every day after i switched to this app it became all fun and i am getting motivated to complete the tasks as i earn rewards suggestion to developer i use browser version more than mobile app please add reminder feature to browser version as well also please add auto date parser while adding the task it will save a lot of time in entering the task you ca take reference from ticktick app,1
the only app that really helped getting through my really busy schedule,1
helpful and fun,1
really helped me stay on top of online classes this year,1
the best app for people with or without adhd,1
thank you,1
very nice app lets you make reminders and actually feel rewarded once you do it,1
love love love the idea behind this,1
i soooo love this app i am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive you wouldnt want your avatar to die so youll do your tasks,1
i am in the unique circumstance of liking to gamify my life and also being horrible at incentivizing doing daily chores this is literally the perfect app for me,1
this app is really pretty annoying it said i didnt allow any permissions but it gave absolutely no further instruction so for a 199 i figured what do i have to lose well i have a lot of time to lose because i spent the money i now have the premium app i set the timer and i got the same message it says you have not set permissions but it gives no instruction as to how to set permissions and no button that i click works if it wasnt too much aggravation id be asking for a refund,0
heart breaking to see that even app allow list requires premium membership please try to help people out and we are ready to support you through ads i hope to receive a reply from the team,0
all the tree just got premium leading to less free content,0
i buyed new mobile and tried to login using it but wasnt able to do that i also tried by signing out other accounts but then also i couldnt look into it,0
not able to restore my account in a new device very worst,0
it is a terrible app it always says forest has stopped workingi hate it dont download,0
在app内付费了两次没有升级到pro版本restore显示error且没有refundedi need my money back,0
a sloth is faster than this app literally,0
awesome app but developer is chinese boycott china we want made in india app,0
b ad,0
the new update locked several of the trees behind a paywall this is disgraceful because all users should be able to unlock them by using the app there is no justification for taking away important parts of the app that were previously available to everyone and now only premium users can access them the devs must change this back so that all previously released trees can be unlocked by anyone edit there are many other reviews with the same problem but the devs dont care listen to the users,0
i found a replacement for you now and i am very happy  its the study bunny app and has all the features which your pro version has in free  uninstalling this app ,0
their should be alarm type sound when we complete some task,0
initially it was a very great experience with this app but nowadays the app suddenly gets closed and the tree gets dead,0
this program has gotten worse by updating this is not acceptable,0
used to like this app alot but now i have less motivation in earning coins since i have to get premium to get the trees i want  saw the developers reply in others alike review but i hope they make an effort to create trees that compensate the update,0
used to love the app they make you give phone access to be in leader boards and buy premium for interesting trees i understand they are worried about pirated software but they are sacrificing their user base in exchange,0
it say over 25 mil downloads and there are only 10 mil downloads,0
this app really helps me focus i can study with a go,0
nice app,0
its helpful but i need it my phone and my phone is ios and my parents wont let me pay,0
the pear tree challenge is a major turn off,0
i have one question how to use sunshine,1
please add more trees baobab is amazing great incentive for funny trees,1
is a great app to focus on doing your homework or the work you need to do,1
i really like it but there are some things that i need to pay for them,1
i like this app so far it seems cool,1
the app is very good but i want to add a ring when the time finished it will be an excellent app when this future in it,1
i cant pay for the premium version,1
app is good working but i cant get notifications when time is over i hope to thats just a little problem,1
they asked me to rate them,1
good app,1
aplicativo top abraços,1
is a greap app to stop looking at the phone every 5 sec and getting distracted,1
i hope this gives more opportunities for people without pro version as mostly students are using and we cant really afford to payoverall i love this apps and helps me so much ,1
this has been really helpful for me to be more productive i wish that there were one or two more trees available at the start as this would motivate me more to make my forest look different and id spend more time earning more coins its a slight incentive but it would work for me i like the fact that i get the redirect message if i happen to tap on an app that i shouldnt be using,1
постоянно чтото всплывает и деревьев мало,1
i like the app i can manage my time more but im confused why its not ringing when the work is done,1
nice app to keep focused but the premium its ok but the app soo good,1
overall nice app but it shows a update notification every time i open the app which sucks but apart from that very nice app for measuring productivity,1
best but paid,1
i love it but would it be possible to have a pause button in case the user diverts herself from the task by reason of bathroom breaks or any other just cause i love it though thank you,1
nice app  for students,1
,1
referal system is a little wonky but its great for studying,1
awesome app to focus in study,1
help you to foucs and also activate the reward system in your brain,1
an alarm would be a perfect addition,1
very nice nice but,1
great app fun to use would have given it 5 stars if you could take 5 min break on the same plant then continue growing it i like working with the pomodoro method,1
интересное приложение,1
,1
i have premium but thought it would be better if there are more trees available since players are able to build their own biome eg desert that would add more fun to the app,1
the problem with this is that when my phone screen is off it doesnt give a notification that the tree is planted even though do not disturb is off and silent mode is off and the notification are on please fix this,1
good for studying and doing revision,1
this is a very nice app but some free features are kind of limited to use until you get the premium features but i still use it though,1
is it a chinese or taiwanese official app  ans me,1
i love the app but i personally would love it if i could plant trees with the coins i made since i have forest i am a lot more concentrated,1
good,1
honestly this is super helpful little sad half of the tree choices are only available if paid for but the rest of it works really well,1
very nice app,1
its a very useful app for the people who wants to concentrate for a big amount of time without checking their phones im a student and i use this app every time that i do my assignments for the day because it helps me to stay focused on what im doing,1
good app to focus,1
i wanna get allow list but cant buy pro version in our country,1
so good,1
i like trees,1
i think this app is very useful because when i didnt have this app my little brother cant finish his homework on time but when i setted 30 minutes for the forest my little brother already finished five homework in 30 minutes,1
amazing tool for studying,1

its hard to pay in china mainland,1
good positive reward n feedback system based app for focused stay,1

i really love this app and my friends and i have created a remote study group using it one suggestion i have is i wish my friends could join into my group study session at any time after theyve been invited and just plant a tree for how long the rest of the session lasts if i am using deep focus i cant communicate with my group about setting up another study session and at what time itd be nice if they could just join for the remaining time,1

i love this app it provides me a method to avoid distraction but ever since they locked most of the plants with a paywall i dont know about that now i cant buy the plants that i want without payingbut i understand they had to do this at some point ,1
loving the app,1
deleted old tags show up again when installing app on another device also my timer doesnt start automatically in plant together mode and i can quit even when room owner started the timer it takes 1020s to sync the countdown timer,1
great productivity app,1
original,1
if i purchase pro version on my one phone and after a month i changed my mobile so after that can i use my previous pro version in new mobile,1
good,1
هايل بصح خصرتوها كي درتو التسجيل بالدراهم,1
the limited no of trees in the new update upsets me ,1
liked it but would have been better if it had more of a game like feel i mean if we did not use for like 40 min may be there could be a bird if we did not use it for another 40 min may be she could lay an egg in another 40 min that egg may hatch like that its just an example,1

notifications and reminders dont work at all defeats the purpose,0
saturday please make saturday as an option in the days week starts with im a premium user and there should be a response to my suggestions by at least replying my email,0
stupid app with adds,0
i sent them email for help regarding premium purchase and they never responcedit has been months or more,0
previously i use to get those quotes and will be able to get reminder with sound but now nothing is working so disappointed ,0
im sure its a fine app but i cant create an account or login with social unusable,0
bad vvvvvv bad,0
i bought the premium version back in 2016 i wanted to start using this again its been many days now and i have not heard anything about getting premium back,0
dont start,0
my rating reflects how well this app fits my needs not how well the app works ,0
it was a meh app good for a while and then the server crash i cant even login anymore i already purchased the premium version but cannot use it anymore so sad to say this but i really regreted buying the premium version bye dev,0
causes my phone to consistently crash anytime i try to log in,0
it doesnt allow me to log in even though i type correct email and password,0
only 5 give at least 10 habits for free,0
login with facebook doesnt work and neither does registering with an email,0
notifications dont work,0
app crashes upon logging in to facebook,0
unresponsive widget,0
there is no a daily checklist where i can see what is remaining for today,0
app is good enough  but hanging  not working  making bad your phone  dont download it  it will make your phone worst situation ,0
it said hello superwoman which was pretty annoying uninstalled,0
cant use the app because it wont let me in keeps telling me to login but nothing happens,0
cant even sign in error notif says i have no internet connection,0
suddenly stopped giving any notifications without these the app just isnt useful at all,0
eh pretty good but i dont like it ,0
8820 update signed in 3 devices added 7 habits no sync on any of devices fail original post 73119 i bought premium in 2016 worked great was a 5 app recently had to uninstallreinstall and now wont sync,0
why do email id and password aap email id qu magate ho eese aapako kayaa ,0
the notification and alarm functions dont work,0
just 5 habits free ,0
no longer reminds me to do stuff looking for another app now,0
limited number of habits only 5,0
app keeps crashing,0
the widget doesnt work properly it only works when i open the app first and then go to widget again kindly fix this,0
does not allow tracking of more than 5 habits without upgrading unable to remove or hide features that are of no use to me do not recommend waste of time,0
worst app requires premium membership to sync data even after signing up with email whats the use of signing up with email if you cannot sync the data its just a calender without premium membership better to use default inbuilt calender app to track your progress than using this application ive lost all my progress that ive been tracking from 300 days shittiest app ever,0
can only track 5 habits at a time,0
really liked the app and have been using premium but now i want to transfer to a new device i can only doing this by signing up but whenever i go to the sign up section and type my email and password nothing happens and it asks me to sign up again really frustrating if you guys can solve this it will definitely be 5 stars,0
limited free goals,0
u bought the app but cant reach my premium account,0
limited to 5 habits in the free trial waste of time this is not a useful free trial for me i have 7 things im tracking,0
i have tried a lot to set up reminderbut unfortunately its not working which is pretty excruciating as a new user it seems good initially but this is pissing me off do ler me know i can fix up this ,0
force closing on android 10,0
havent been able to get a reply from customer support since august 2019  if you cant get your email registered you cant use this across multiple devices super disappointed,0
ive been using this since 2015now with new phone it didnt sync and expect me to upgrade again fix it please else it will remain at 1 star my feedback  posted few weeks ago was ignored uninstall for good,0
was really enjoying the app but now the widgets stopped working,0
only 5 habits,0
dont pay for this app its outdated and not supported by developper anymore,0
last updated 2018 really i am a premium user and it crashes sometimes bad investment,0
only 5 habits if you dont want to pay its not worth having,0
such a bad experience i bought the app and now it says they cant find my email id in their database i am trying to reach them for 4 days no response just automated mails so pathetic,0
stupid app,0
it doesnt work or show any reminders whatsoever and no picturea as it says i wasted my money,0
sync problem is a dealbreaker all that info is now lost i used it for over a year ,0
for anyone who wants to use this app devs stopped updating this in 2018 so they wont reply to your queries andor issues look elsewhere,0
im unsatisfied with this application not show negative feedback so it cant best app,0
twice lost all data bc wouldnt sync had over a year of data had premium and still didnt make a difference moving on just done so upset,0
the premium version of the app does not sync across multiple devices i use an android phone and a chromebook and it still does not work dont bother with premium,0
i have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly i am connected to the internet i am a premium user the app is great but please help me with my problem im tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error,0
guess i cant use this app after paying for premium ,0
not updated anymore unstable,0
nobody use this app read all the forums the app does not support the sync once youve bought premium everyones saying the same and the devs do not respond to help requests i have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly i am connected to the internet i am a premium user the app is great but please help me with my problem im tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error,0
ugly ui jiss fb login dosent work,0
i bought the premium version and it will not sync i have snet numerous requests to support and have received no responses,0
spamming me to rate well here you go,0
app crashes,0
this app lost all my data i would sync every day but when i had to reinstall and tried to syncnothing i had paid the money for premium but now it wants me to pay again,0
premium does not work false advertising,0
how do i get a refund,0
i was enjoying this app and decided to buy the premium features but they took the money and provided nothing at all i tries contacting the developer via email and no answer at all stay away,0
vorrei avere indietro i miei soldi visto che il login non funziona e che non sembra esistere unassistenza tecnica i want my money back since i cannot login,0
after installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls after removing the app from my phone i received fewer spam calls it might be a coincidence but it might not be,0
paid for premium sync does not work publisher does not reply started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem going to try to get my money back nice app if you dont care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support switched to goalify and finding them extremely responsive,0
this app doesnt sync data,0
sync not working dont buy inapp purchase,0
paid for premium does not sync,0
failed to connect to facebook,0
facebook login fails with an error from facebook saying the login method hasnt bee implemented correctly,0

hyper masculine tone is very offputting and irritating hint to developers women try to change habits too at least give us the option of just having hints in our own words,0
its working anymore after paying for premium,0
does not log in after 5 minites its still trying to log itself in,0
online sync is no longer working and last update was june 2018 which is more than a year is there a reason why i should continue using this app,0

lies no multidevice syncing on premium,0
premium subscription for such a simple app is greedy,0
files lost forver no updates and broken,0
awsome application i purched it but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock  plz add this type of features the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen from last 10 month its not getting synchronising plz do something developer we paid for it,0

sync not working anymore,0
i have paid for the premium features but the sync is not working i mailed them but got no response,0
the app hasnt synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user the support team havent acknowledged my email its a good concept but theyve failed to make it work and dont provide customer support check other reviews go to playgooglestore on a web browser select my account and go to order history select the  and it offers you an option to request a refund that should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling,0
only 5 habit you can update,0
very poor customer support despite being a paid subscriber strongly recommend against this app not able to sync across devices and there was no response despite sending mails,0
sync isnt working no response to emails no updates for ages,0
its been 1 week since im using the app the reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning really disappointed may be uninstalling the app after few days hope this helps,0
like another commenter said just installed it on new phone and even though signed in it doesnt give my my paid for premium previous phone checked the sync and last sync was 128 days ago,0
not free,0
sync doesnt work,0
takes ages to load each time i open it up used to be good time to say goodbye,0
cant log in with facebook,0
reminder did not appear,0
unnecessary limiting of number of habits to be tracked use habit loop app instead,0
app is not supported anymore and syncing not working,0
reminder does not work,0
appears to be an abandoned app,0
synchronisation is not working its dishonest to sell a service that doesnt exist ,0
no quotes,0
the user interface is not user friendly no one likes to use a complicated app to build habits which will make their work even more harder make it simple and easy to understand man,0
it is difficult to understand,0
the widgets do not work please add auto back and provide some analyticsgraphs on the habits management and formation,0
like many premium users i received an automated email letting me know that following a bug my password was reset after that impossible to use the premium features any more developer doesnt respond such a shame,0
reminders are not on time,0
wont allow me to register or make an account tried to set up without on to try it out but as soon as you lose the app the habits you have set up disappear not the best trial,0
reminders aint working,0
a little too complicated and dictatorial too many prompts plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version 710 habits and i may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run instead i decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs,0
free account limited to 5 habits,0
complexity and unavailability of useful feature for free kill the interest atleast widget should be available for trials,0
only the premium version is good for use free version is a waste of time,0
only 3 stars because after the first 5 options no more then u have to pay,0
can login with facebook because there is an issue with login implementation uninstalling,0
reminders havent been working,0
sync no longer working,0
unable to import any data from the csv file in cloud no option to get any data back bought premium and im not happy beware,0
loading takes too long and reminders dont work,0
the moderation of the discussion bards in the app leaves something to be desired needs better moderation,0
sync no longer works also app has been buggy lately  closes down and does not respond im now using loop habit tracker which is more stable,0
mixed great app but dont by premium wont work without play services and developer unresponsive,0
editupdate  purchased premium sync doesnt work a quick glance at developers fbtwitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the earth no activity since 2018 app hasnt received an update since 2018 my suggestion pick an app thats still actively developed exactly what i have been looking for fantastic interface and thoughtful design im hooked guys,0
the motivational messages are annoying you can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more good riddance i suppo this kind of app is just not for me,0
i liked the app until it told me i could only have 5 goals ,0
only 5 items on free version would be nice to have that clear so i dont have to waste my time and give out my email,0
love and use the app but sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing,0
the app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating i paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good,0
i was testing this to replace fabulous so far the notifications are not persistent enough fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning,0
do not buy premium version app stopped synching 7272019 and is no longer supported i got premium to sync to new phone since ive been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking 10 wasted very disappointing because basic version is great  simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits good visuals and the ability to make notes premium  tracking 5 habits and syncing across devices but no more would be 4 stars if still supported and worked,0
having trouble syncing on new device says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong,0
too much fluff difficult to see the actual progress,0
i bought the premium and i cant sync the data between my devices,0
ive set a reminder for me to drink water it doesnt remind at all,0
paid widget feature one thing that downplays all other,0
does not sync,0
worked okay for awhile sync between devices no longer works and i have the paid for premium account uninstalled on both devices sync fails on both,0
no notification of habit tracks,0
desde hace unos meses no sirve la sync ni me deja entrar a la cuenta,0
cannot sync what is going on,0
the app doesnt really look like the screenshots its also quite outdated in design if you dont mind paying for it then it gets the job done,0
please add a feature that make me add a friend to the habit such as habit competition app i cant live without this feature,0
not a bad app but dont pay for the premium the widgets dont work,0
unable to register via manual and via fb,0
a little too confusing,0
good,0
the app requires premium membership to use the widget defeats the point for me,0
i m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit buildinglets see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get dots connected in pattern thats not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward,0
couldnt login with facebook,0
it is completely failing on reminders,0
please change the logo,0
terrible ui,0
the layout was good but it only lets you track 5 habits for free,0
its not worth the premium i tried to get a refund because it wasnt what i thought it would be and no one has contacted me they claim to read every single email but cant reply to a paid customer i will be deleting this app and regretting the 8 purchase,0
there needs to be an option on when the habit starts,0
awesome tracker yet it seems overpriced in my country way more more than the typical range of 5 its about 10 for me with tax included also i dont appreciate the greyed out price being the same as the 33 claimed discounted price very deceiving lastly the lack of support for a fingerprint access method is subpart for 2019,0
used to be my favorite app changed phones and it doesnt recognize my premium purchase ive been emailing for support for two months with no response so disappointed,0
i love the ease of the application and the setup i dont like that the way they send you reminders that are sometimes rude or shamebased it doesnt make me want to try any harder when i get scolded for not fulfilling my goals positive encouragement as the best way,0
i want to start my week with saturday and it is not available only can change between sunday  monday ,0
useless you need a premium account to use widgets,0
started off really well but has stopped working properly now great shame as it has a lot of promise,0
crashes on sign in on my pixel 2 xl,0
stuck on setting up your account,0
reminders are not working i have an asus zenfone 4 shouldnt matter and i have set the reminders multiple times with no success i feel this is the most important part of this app as i need reminding in order to affectively create a habit any feedback would be greatly appreciated my rating my change after feedback,0
two stars because facebook login is not fixed for an year is this application still supported by the dev team,0
i didnt like it,0
none of the notifications work other people in the forums teport similar problems bht no fix the app is nice but it isnt nearly as functional without notifications,0
i dont like the layout at all i want it to be much more simple and quick to edit my daily tasks,0
love the app would love a version for windowschrome to use on pc also i bought a premium version and now when i opened the app after 4 months it has reset itself to the nonpremium version,0
paid for this years ago and used it on another device now i have a new phone and when im trying to login it says my email address is not in the database,0
it stops sending notifications randomly,0
good concept with poor design the widget needs a redesign  currently it wastes a lot of space on my homescreen the forum section is good,0
i like the overall app it is the best but even after setting the reminder for my habits i do not receive any notification or reminder i have checked with my notification settings for this app and it is turned on,0
please dont call me darling my app reminder called me darling not cool,0
works ok on galaxy note 8 but constant crash notifications cant even log on to the tablet version let alone sync accounts in the end all data lost and so am i,0
free version only supports 5 habits which is basically nothing,0
only 5 free without telling users upfront that you will have to pay for more always about the money sorry i wasted time on setting this up,0
didnt like it,0
lost my premium and all my habits gone when i changed my device the app was great but doesnt seem good for long term use,0
the fact that with the free version doesnt let someone track more than 5 habits its a shame,0
worked for about a day and then just crashed repeatedly so have uninstalled disappointed as looked really good,0
i think its really petty that the widget only comes with a premium account no thanks,0
id give it five stars but it keeps bugging me to rate it,0
constantly tells me to provide a rating,0
sync isnt working lost my data again,0
cluttered and unintuitive,0
the app crashes and closes when trying to sync i have the platinum plan,0
only track 5 habits for free,0
the reminders never work,0
widgets require premium,0
it doesnt let you have more than 5 habits without getting premium,0
how can i delete my account all i see is an option for deleting data,0
does not load,0
until recently i enjoyed the app but somehow my purchased premium status is not recognized anymore contacted the developers by email but got no response so sad ,0
i bought the premium version and sometimes a habit wont chainlink between successful days you have to delete and recreate it then it will chainlink between successful days again,0
widget only for premium account,0
the motivational photo is missing,0
whyd it log me out edit the push notifications dont push anymore,0
i love this app but the widget doesnt work most times which is very annoying,0
i dont know how its work i wanna give it 5stars but when alarm is once set and when it rangbit dosnt stop untill u switch off the phone,0
decent app for habit tracking unsubscribing from their premium membership is a headache,0
it is great for keeping track of my habits but i never get any reminders ive checked my phone and all the permissions are there but still no reminders i just get a tiny message that tells me the app is running but disappears without doing anything ill persevere a bit longer but if it doesnt remind me there isnt much point as i will forget to do things,0
too costly for premium,0
in theory it helps track habits but after 30 or 40 days the reminders stop appearing randomly then just disappear completely rest of the app works well perhaps its my device but be aware,0
not used,0
super easy to use less friction i like how users can discuss progress with each other its very helpful,0
looks like a powerful tool but the ui is a dealbreaker for me hopefully it receives a major redesign in the future,0
,0
its okay premium version is more useful,0
it is a good app ive been using it for quite some time and i think i m progressing and this really is helping me just a bit dissapointed bcs it doesnt have a full progress tracker as a graph and i wish they will install this feature nearby in the future hopefully,0
its about what id expect from a habit tracker i chose this over another one for the motivational quotes only they just just up as the error picture icon without the actual picture if i cant get the picture can i at least get alternative text for the picture that has the quote moto z2 force,0
i wish there are better graphs to see the dips and raises in my performance the current one is way too compressed and looks just like a straight line inspite of the dips,0
the app is great now some bugs are fixed notificationreminders still dont work for me 699month seems steep to record more than 5 habits,0
good,0
i think i like it but not fully sure yet was getting daily notifications then they stopped and i forgot all about some habits will restart again,0
the app design could be better,0
great app  could you guys add a option like task archive because there are some habits like typing practice i want to follow and dont want to delete the data give a option to hide the habit without losing data,0
i was unable to create checklists in the way i want im better off using microsoft excel,0
nice one but its expensive,0
why is it called habit bull upon installation and it also has a different app icon misleading,0
good app but it doesnt have riminder as it says,0
nice and easy way to keep track of your streaks and habits also pretty cool that there are comment boards so you can interact with people doing the same things nice to get encouragement and share tips really cool app overall,0
pretty good app,0
nice app,0
ok,0
not totally friendly environment,0
pretty good app but the continuous nagging to rate it in the play store gets annoying in a hurry,0
i like the alerts  its a good free app i think it be nice if i could click the day then get an option for if i completed my task or not,0
still learning to use it,0
its good easy to use,0
would need an ui refresh,0
wish i could track more than 5 habits without paying,0
great app,0
the app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working i have bought the pro version,0
theres this weird bug now where the screen dims and keeps showing the loading sign but you can still use the buttons please fix it,0
everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits,0
best habit tracker  edit can you guys fix the overall habitbull score graph its not accurate always trending down no matter what,0
facebook login not working,0
i am not satisfied with this app because circles used for completing the habits look very dirty ,0
this deserves 5 stars but i am not able to see discussions since the last one week,0
probably a good app and way to track your new habits but not being able to make a widget without a premium account is ridiculous,0
i really like this app and find it useful for keeping me on track simple but effective i used the free version for almost 2 years at the end of the first year it reset and i lost all of my history so before the end of the second year i bought the premium version and promptly lost all of my history again i contacted support to see if they could help and got no response at all i still recommend it for tracking your habits but dont expect to keep the info long term or get help if you need it,0
really enjoying this app but wish i could track more than 5 habits,0
too invasive and complicated,0
nice app,0
it delivers what it promises,0
its good app but its not free if you want to add more than 5 habit,0
odd that it doesnt count beginning and end of month corrctly in monthly tally,0
the interface is intuitive i am giving a three because my online data did not sync when i upgraded,0
no of activities that we can add is only 5 thats why i give this 3 ,0
pretty good app,0
this app is good but i cant access 5 habit because i need premium to access it ,0
does exactly one thing  tracks habits  but does it well and without pointless bloaty extras or ads clean interface sadly app seems to have been abandoned by developers and premium features like sync no longer work no way to transfer data,0
i liked how i could customize everything but my linked google fit didnt update my steps i had to input myself and my notifications would only go off if i opened the app myself kind of defeats the purpose of linking and setting up notifications,0
the sync feature doesnt work,0
limited functionality but reliable,0
went for the premium subscription without a doubt definitely benefitial to those to use it honestly edit everythings good but after changing phones ive suffered having to manually copy the same habit list because the sync function just doesnt work,0
the app is great i wanted to use this app as a way to help me to creat a better habit and staying on track with certain things for me the notifications dont work unles i open the app and by that point its like my reminders have passed other then that easy app to use and navigate,0
dont get any reminders for the goals inspite of setting it a number of times,0
pretty average app,0
the reminder option is not workingi have paid for premium to use the app to its full potential but unfortunatelythe basic feature of the app to remind you to stick to your schedule with respect to habits you creat dosent workkindly help by resolving this issue color code options are limited that can be assigmed to the newly added habit,0
a great way to track goals but quite limited in functionaliry and the google fit integration doesnt work,0
could do with a reward or goal feature when habit followed,0
its an okay app but i have found better ones such as i am sober this needs to be paid for to be useful,0
the app does not let me create a widget despite the fact that i have logged in ,0
the free app is too limited other than that its a good one,0
i just started using this app my week actually starts with saturdays while only sundays and mondays are mentioned if you could modify this detail thatd be really appreciated ,0
synching between my chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app the color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive,0
app is awesome n also helps alot but its inbuilt password once forgot dont opens the app evertime i need to log out and again log in it plz solve my issue,0
i really like this application very well done  my reason for 3 and  not 5stars is the lack of any security no option for fingerprint or pin before viewing what could be sensitive personal information  please add security,0
good app but faulty notifications the notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if i open the app by that point its too late i need the reminders to work to be effective i purchased the full version,0
its ok but a bit too simple and the inspirational messages dont change not really very motivating to use this app compared to my previous habit tracker the apps look doesnt come exciting to look at as well,0
i paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation they fix that problem,0
shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly otherwise all around good app,0
,0
good,0
its a great app and works great helps me keep track of whether or not i took pills or did excercises or not however it lacks the feature of multiple times a day so if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day this app wont help since you can only click that you did it once does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature,0
i bought the paid verison it does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers but habits arent as simple as it is we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time if i want to develop a habit of waking up by 7 it shouldnt be a yes or no question i should be able to enter the time track it over the month,0
i really like the app maybe just work on improving the graphs a bit more,0
good,0
good app but only counts by day 5 stars if there was an option to count times a week as well,0
nice but no daily notification come,0
unable to set custom notification sound it uses default sound even after changing others looks good,0
love it,0
good app minus one star because of the constant nagging and thats in the paid version ,0
ok app,0
great for creating or breaking habits thanks so much,1
great,1
solid habit tracking app great for what i needed it for,1
works great i use it for almost everything especially when taking a new medicine or starting a new thing i want to continue,1
works well and i love the cheery greetings,1
good,1
would love to see a yearly review  other than that awesome app,1
nice app i wish there was an option to move a goal though for example i want to workout 3 days a week this app has you choose 3 set days i dont necessarily know my schedule and would like to move around a goal otherwise i dig,1
great,1
easy to use,1
have used this app for almost two years i loved the minimalistic features despite all other confusing apps out there it would be great if worked on making it an aesthetic user interface ,1
i really like the app however few weeks ago ive changed my phone for new one  samsung galaxy a51 and now ive problems with a widget sometimes it is posible to check that habits are done with the widget and sometimes it is not it looks like the widget just freeze can you help me,1
very good for habit maker,1
i like it for a free app,1
good,1
helpful for building habits,1
very good app to track good habits,1
the inspiration posters are not loadingviewable,1
when i add time to the habit it is in decimal so week and month totals are incorrect eg 130  140 is according to app 270 while it is 310 actually,1
the app helps me a lot i would like to have more information about the action and habits tracking into an online dashboard,1
i enjoy watching my habits become habits everyday i just wish there was a theme i could use,1
good for me,1
good simple app but sometimes it doesnt download,1
works very well,1
can we please add number of days per fortnight as an option to select along with week month and year,1
the tracking system is good,1
easy to use and customize only 5 habits without premium payment,1
good application,1
very good app and it helped me to form habits,1
very basic but helps keep track of things,1
too overloaded main screen,1
app is nice but somehow i m not able to delete the habbit which i recently added by mistake pls guide,1
very good could use some more flare ,1
update on 81320 fixed the reminder notifications thank you,1
it is a great app maybe it could have a more attractive interface,1
good app to track your habits and build on good ones,1
this app is very good,1
good reminders for habit formation,1
good,1
a really easy way to track new habits i have looked at other apps and this is much easier thank you habitbull,1
very nice app,1
a very simple habit tracker easy to use,1
useful,1
so far so good it does do this weird thing where it highlights a different app after ive exited the app though bit of a weird bug,1
motivational and funny remiders really help in pushing to do the task,1
good,1
sync doesnt work,1
,1
nice app the icon got problem,1
nice,1
an improvement would be to see running total on all habits page quite expensive for what it does,1
good,1
good app,1
good appbut they could add something like notification bar tab or floating widget or something so as to remind us constantly to keep us in check in order to develop out habits,1
its great and easy to use but still the developers should try to make it some sort of strict,1
very useful and encourages motivation,1
notification features should be free,1
good,1
very conveniant and useful the reminder function is also really nice to stay on top of activities,1
easy and convenient apps but the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best,1
loving it so far keeps me motivated ,1
good as motivation to track and tick off daily goals,1
good app no lags does what it says im happy,1
happy to see my progress its a great app to keep a track for my daily routines and things which i paid limited attention to create that into my regular day to day life,1
im a big kid id love it if the circles you tap to colour in were star shaped,1
its a quite useful program works reliably,1
if wish the images of quotes would have the previous option too,1
i like the app but dont like the big list of discussions about guys not trying to masterbate at the bottom,1
it helps me to change my habbit,1
simple but effective,1
wish it had a little more options but still great and easy app,1
this has been a great app to build habits i would give it a 5 star but your limited to only 5 habits at a time you can get more but theres a pay wall,1
great tool,1
very good quality app for habits,1
simple yet perfectly helping me achieve my goals,1
very helpful app for us to quitjoin any kind of habit with the help of this app i have now completed my 60 days of no smoking challenge thankyou habit bull,1
already helped a lot wish it had more colors,1
good habit tracking app,1
why there is different icon showing of app in play store and different on my phone pls make it same,1
great app,1
this has been a pretty indispensable tool for me it motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes i would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise my personality requires checklists or ill find excuses to skip doing things,1
its a little too early to tell so far pretty good,1
really remarkable app,1
get me focused and motivated,1
i liked this app it is really helping me and reminding me to do things on time and i am able to be proactive,1
sehr hilfreich,1
home,1
genial,1
can ui can be improved to add habits with more customisation,1
great,1
numerical entries should default to the previous days value,1
easy to use and helpful to keep good habits on track,1
cest bon,1
loved it motivates me to keep me on track with my set targets,1
ok,1
i love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals theres only two things that could make this app better being able to disable decimals on specific habits to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made,1
bug has been fixed now i can use it with all my devices,1
great tool,1
useful app,1
good app really helpfulbut i think it should include permanent tracker in the dropdown menu,1
great to get started with a healthier lifestyle,1
great for keeping track of my workout and non drinking days,1
free and easy to track ur new habits,1
great its simple,1
good app to track habits,1
animations are a bit choppy and mediocre design but great functionality,1
only 5 hapits for free,1
easy to use but it seems really basic,1
love it except i cant change the positive memes at the bottom anymore,1
great app i am using it for a while functionality wise it the best in the market it can get updated in terms of visuals and performance,1
uiux can be improved a bit more,1
i like the design,1
heyyy dear developers love the app but have a issue in it idk if it is only with me the app doesnt show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal only 1st day it does,1
 which is disappointing the sync function doesnt work at all and i dont see any effort to fix these issues this is one of the rare apps where i wont be giving a 5 star review,1
extremely easy user interface helpsnin using the app more and note the goals,1
it is all for me about habits i wasnt able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i dont know if didnt find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i dont know if it in the app or not,1
amazing experience,1
best habit tracker app i have used,1
easy to use and very flexible,1
great way to hold yourself accountable for setting goals,1
its cool because its gives me motivation to push myself and allow me to see my struggle in addiction for every day i fail,1
worked well for my purposes,1
love the reminder to log your habits,1
works well the interface is a little odd you have to scroll down to see all the graphs,1
simple app that provides all i need to track habits ui could use a refresher,1
this is closest to my expectations,1
it works well for me,1
it would be a very good choice for those who want a daily base motivation to make your way to build on the habbittry not to break the streak of your habbit goals at any cost from which you can gain the max from this app  well built interface with motivational images loved it,1
its useful,1
very helpful,1
would be perfect if you also have pomodorotimer to do each task,1
good visual reminder and nice to see patterns of habit breaking,1
im using the app for about a week so far so wonderful ,1

good simple app does what it says and doesnt ask anything in return,1
this has been a great experimenti really like this app i feel motivated to see the check marks and have feelings of confidence,1
i like this app would be good if you can implement option that allows miscellaneous days to count towards an activity eg perform a task 3 times a week any nonspecific day,1
simple yet useful what a great app,1
kisses for the developer,1

awesome app,1
the app sends too many notifications with annoying sound ,0
not very intuitive,0
it takes forever to download,0
i havent even opened this app and its already drained 30 percent of my battery wow waste of time and space,0
tested on 4 android versions and devices 1 reminders only work with screen on  app in foreground app doesnt stay in memory 2 cant rearrange hero screen to move graphs to bottom 3 every notification perform button click annoying popup to confirm again cant be disabled 4 needs option for notification x minutes after task startend users need notification to inform what to start plus notification option to confirm its done at the task end time subscibe when fixed,0
rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet,0
kicks me out of the game instantly not for me,0
notification not working,0
my entire plan was suddenly removed,0
this is worst task game in my life,0
way too complicated to use this app could be so much simpler the time ive wasted on it is time i could be doing tasks,0
its not well organized i couldnt organize my schedule nicely i think it should be more simple and easy also reminder didnt work and i dont know why,0
very useful but completely loses its value when you dont get notifications of tasks that you need to do even though you put multiple notifications you could get one and none of the others other times you dont even get any i mean how are you supposed to stay on time on certain tasks when you dont even get the reminder please fix this problem,0
i had to put in all the info,0
it is complicated,0
 but it serves my needs just right and i love it,0
im not interested in subscriptions one time fee would be fine by me,0
kind of ha are to get the hang of maybe im just stupid idk but i never did figure it out,0
not a movable app,0
this is not an rpg this is a goal tracker with an avatar ffs so useless,0
i tried to set task to only do wednesday and friday and it wouldent work so i uninstaled apart from that its a good app,0
not for me i was hoping for something with an alarm doesnt help if i dont get a reminder looks interesting though,0
działa ale zwykła aplikacja habits naprawdę wystarczy,0
application is superb with only 1 big exception which outguns every good thing  duplicate task feature doesnt duplicate any of the underlying subtasks but just links them under the duplicated tasks so you cannot create a template task which could be used to create other similar deep task structures for quicker task creation with similar structures this is a must have feature if you really want to let users use this app deeply and consistently without this i will be forced to look at less,0
too difficult,0
good,0
same review as rpg gamify,0
 etc im certain this adjustment would be greatly appreciated,0
app itself is nice but needs a lot of polish right now its kind of a bugfest,0
this app is great but the setting of the aims and the tasks takes a long period of time therefore it eats up your productivity,0
it is a good application it is very useful it is just okay,0
great app needs  a few things like task fail without consequences option mostly a full paid version without subscription or in app purchase not every one has everything connected to internet all the time,0
this is ok  but it required bunch of upgrade and some new features  will keep it but wait till is it perfect,0
good but not ok,0
are there any guides out there,0
the concept is good but why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though i have turned the notification on this is very bad,0
but then it started locking up everytime i tried to load it  ved it until then,0
how i add multiple user profile,1
it crashes when you complete a task,1
bom,1
tasks in all tasks group is frequently disappearing  reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great,1
love the way this app is helping me its great feature is the way we can track our own progress because of reward system 4 stars only because of apps free theme,1
i love this app i only wish it had a sort of multiplayer for families to connect accounts,1
strong fallout skyrim feel but full buy price is 45 even those games price are lower on sale and i bought them on sale other sold apps price are usually below 5 dollars and the default free theme has nice green background but paid ones only have bright white background i dont sub apps i buy themsub is for something like netflix and spotify,1
it is a lot better than the other apps out an 8 or 16bit ui makeover would be dope the pixel look and feel always nostalgic,1
it been running kind of slow when youre making new tasks,1
its helping me the way i think,1
i really enjoy this app because it stops me from sitting on my butt 247,1
just after i looked at the interface i knew it was what i was searching not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books for anyone who think in terms of goals and obviously who love rpgs its totally free though,1
its a good app for everyday tasks it takes time to customize it and its normal because its an rpg type however i think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless you can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want this bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah,1
the app has a way of motivating you to complete tasks,1
treating activities like a game gives me a sense of accomplishment when i successfully finish my duties and earn xp,1
good,1
nice,1
jibj,1
fun and productive,1
easy to use and good at keeping me motivated throughout the day,1
4,1
keeps me on track,1
i like this app i only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience i hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved i would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough,1
i really like the idea of this app its pretty easy to use and understand and if you liked dd growing up itll remind you of the character buildinglevelling processes which is great if i could make one suggestion add a falconry guy to the avatars ,1
achievements should have reward options such as expgold   otherwise it is a neat app,1
a bit of headache in beginning but awesome,1
great app an alarm would be great with new or better icons in context with the app,1
i really like the idea and would of easily voted 5 on it but it has no alerts or alarms on mine to remind me to do the set task doesnt even send me a notification,1
this is a good app for motivation,1
it was fantastic until it started freezing every time i went to tasks is there a way to fix this,1
love the app i wish there were more features such as adding icons to tasks or adding a quest map,1
nice app best of the ones ive tried but really think about adding some graphics and a much less boring ui look at superbetter for instance also a multiplayer aspect is a glaring omission that almost all your competitors have  try to have stats actually have some meaning or  a way for us to give them meaning,1
could we customize notification sound for successful tasks i want to add final fantasy victory theme but still dont know how to besides that i really like this apps,1
by far the most indepth app of this style tried habitica and others and they were so underdeveloped in comparison in my opinion,1
great software for those who want to succeed i have been using this software for a year and i am completely satisfied with it install it right now,1
perfect i serched to many apps like this but finally i find you best app for upgrade your life u are my hero and i am a premium user now thank you dear dev ,1
really helps me to keep motivated to keep my workouts or chores and its so easy to use,1
best app,1
love the app and the fact the devs listen and add new updates all the time,1
great so far,1
great app it helped me get my life together,1
excelente app e com possobilidades infinitas se você for criativo,1
великолепное приложение отзывчивая поддержка отличный дизайн продуманная и удобная система развития очень интересно ставить себе и родным задачи и вознаграждение за них рекомендую,1
good,1
挺好用的挺好玩的而且还可以同步,1
very useful,1
its great for planning out goals of any time frame whether it be short or long term its also extremely customizable which i adore a lot,1
fun way to manage tasks and improve yourself,1
such an organized convenient way to keep track of my life,1
they should change the name have no idea it would be awesome just from the name,1
good yes me like,1
dont import its resets evryfing to defult,1
this app has helped me keep on track and get better habits,1
really motivates,1
i have only had it for a few days and dont fully understand every feature but it is the only to do list app that has so far worked for me probably because of it being based on a reward system even if the rewards are only virtual,1
great app for goal setting  tracking in a gamified way,1
i love it incredibly customizable keeps me on track to do the things i want to do,1
very active app,1
i think its a pretty straightforward app it definitely helps when you need to place certain tasks throughout your week as a reminder,1
encourages me to complete task,1
rpg bolado,1
this app is just what i needed to make progress on my goals contains a whole bunch of features and customisability it is also easy to use i only have an issue with the task list widget not updating properly after completing a task,1
ive been doing this for several days and its been working wonders,1
probably the best task managing app out there,1
its not that bad,1
awesome app the best ive ever used,1
fun versatile,1
im having lots of fun i feel motivated to do more in the day so far i have had no adds and the free version has everything you could need i just hope it will work for me long term,1
very good app for complete tracking,1
great app changing my life,1
really cute but im more into minimalist designs it works really well tho if the interface seems like ur thing i like that they have a reward system i might just get it back just for that bc no other app that ive seen has that,1
best habbit app,1
really fun and thorough ,1
i need more options of anything,1
best task app ever,1
i need the application thanks developers ,1
awesome,1
exceptional,1
this app is amazing im having fun just setting up that being said an optional progress bar for tasks would be really helpful,1
excellent app,1

awesome,1
very good,1
its a great app,1
great idea managing yourself like playing game,1
fun way to track tasks,1
nice app very use full,1
amazing,1
its a really great app i love most that it reminds you about your tasks since i tend to forget a lot especially feeding my pets and watering my plants its easy and fun to use especially with the reward system i think it would be challenging if the app had personal rewards for say keeping up with your tasks for a large period of time and all but honestly i love the app its perfect you can personalize it to whatever you want or need,1
it really really good,1
seems to be useful so far,1
the idea is just wow well executed,1
great work mates,1
great productivity app to stay organized,1
i really love this app its fantastic in many ways i wish i could adjust the overdue settings as tasks are set as overdue too quickly for me ,1
amazing,1
does everything i want it to do and more,1
hmm i like it,1
this is my first time with a rpg but i love this to do list,1
gufy,1
so far loving this app,1
i enjoy this app because i am a task oriented person and i can see how much i have completed and the xp gaming quality to it makes me feel like i m reaching for a goal with immediate gratification not just doing work,1
very easy to personalise and use 5,1
very nice,1
this app is really great easy to keep track of all my many activities,1
best life rpg app that i could find support is very helpful and fast at responding everything other app i tried was all about them milking money but not this one,1
great its been helping me a lot,1
es buena para aser mis abitos y mis tareas tiene muchas occiones,1
one of the bests todo apps,1
good apps,1
fun way to celebrate your accomplishments,1
best motivational game style to do list app ive tried subscription cost is very reasonable and the free version is great too definitely recommend,1
amazing app,1
this app makes me so much more productive,1
great app,1
estive procurando por um aplicativo como esse,1
very neat,1
cest la meilleure application pour vaincre la procrastination,1
great app for a todo list with a hint of gamer mentality,1
very good so far,1
дякую,1
good,1
im a gamer and dislike doing chores this gives incentive,1
i have had zero motivation to do anything lately with the whole cortana thing going on but this really helps me get things done,1
a frightfully creative and entertaining way getting your tasks done ,1
good,1
ok,1
wonderful app thank you developer please keep update,1
no end of task habit days so useless,0
very worst app,0
worst app,0
only 7 free habits,0
this what is really useful to me it is useful to manage my time it is the good app for time management i prefer download this app and and use,0
bad app,0
no notification showing,0
it is a super app i wouldnt forget my activity,0
it was confusing,0
costs money to make pixels darker,0
zero integration with any calendar so literally worthless,0
limited habits,0
its says error when copying data when i tried to export data can you please mail me the solution again please,0
absolutely hated it it was just weird,0
too expensive,0
dark mode in premium,0
you can only add 7 habit for free version,0
cool idea but i never got any of the notifications which is kinda the whole point,0
cant see all habbits report in one screen when by mistake you delete a habbit never can see again any where your previous data,0
no habits library,0
i dont get this app,0
now a days almost all app give you dark mode out of cost but this app gives us as a premium feature cant edit the start date either needed to delete and start again,0
cant really use it without the ability to create your own categories,0
i wanna like it but i need it to allow me to set my routine to repeat every day without having to rewrite my routine for every day or am i missing something,0
sahi h,0
notification and alarm will automatically turn on even if i have turned off before,0
limited habit data,0
great so far i only wish i could set up one task for more than 1 day its kind of annoying when you have to do the same tasks daily to have to add them daily if i could go into the date section and choose multiple days or months that would be amazing also making it so i can choose a time range would also be really helpful some of my tasks need to be 2 or 3 hrs long and right now i can only choose a time for a reminder itll help keep me more organized time wise if you added these thanks,0
it igood,0
why i does not able to add task on a specifically day of every week,0
it would be 5 stars if could sinc it with other device,0
not worth it if you cant go pro,0
ok so its not bad but for me it was a little bit hard to work but dont get me wrong there are probably loads of people that do understand it it was just a little hard for me ,0
very disappointed that you have a very limited amount of habits and you require premium to be removed i feel it should be lifted,0
le mode alarme ne fonctionne pas bien,0
could you please add sub tasks and checklist and also to add new category,0
i havent found the way to edit the days of the week for one habit,0
theek hai,0
i dont like u use numbers instead of yes or no but it doesnt show any difference on the calendar eg color difference,0
great app but it never archived old chores so didne let points,0
you can have just 5 habits for free we should have more,0
i like this app its simple and gets the job done only downside is youre allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version,0
i cant arrange my habits in the order i want i have to choose from preselected options like alphabetical,0
it has almost everything that i need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view thats really the most important thing to see how many days youve tracked in a row switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything you have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like,0
i have enough credit but i cant purchase for premium,0
i dont get any notification on the tasks to be done neither do alarm work and so i am get frustrated pls do help me with this apart from that it is a good habit tracking app,0
i would give 5 stars if it had the feature to rearrange the items with your specific order instead or being predetermined,0
lobe this app but the only thing that is stopping me from getting premium is that i am unable to arrange the habits in order habits are also not arranged according to time and it makes it so hard to find them if you do fix it i will purchase this app,0
please give google login option so i can backup my data easily,1
this app is really nice and makes me to build good habits but only thing is annoying in this app is you cant import more than 7 habits until you get premium,1
best hai ji,1
its pretty good user friendly app developer gotta work or widget improvements though other that than it gets the job done,1
nice app,1
good app but need more features for premium users 4 sure,1
very helpfull i use it often to track my studies and to make sure i take out and put in my retainer when i start getting a paycheck i plan on buying the full version,1
those having trouble after closing app n not geting reminders and alarms the ans is go to ur mob settings and add habit now app to wonts sleep,1
its very helpful,1
wow bt one thing make me pain  that is money,1
its awesome,1
great app very stable so far,1
good so far,1
nice app,1
so far so good,1
i wish if i can mentor my progress in habits by points not only by days,1
thank you,1
nice app,1
nice,1
love to use,1
absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed was previously using todoist for this purpose and just switched to habitnow  some other useful features  add a length to a task or habit  be able to set a time so that tasks and daily habits can be sorted by time of day,1
just using the free version has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book im reading i like,1
easy to use,1
ufff me ayuda demasiado xq soy de las personas q se olvidan las cosas y esta app es la unica q encontre q tenia alarma,1
its good i wish i had different lists and could personalize the sound my alarms made each tine they went off,1
dashboard charts better be inclusive all habits not just per one habit also download to excel would be nice,1
does exactly what it says would be 5 stars if the categories could be customised,1
wish i could add more habits,1
straight forward i like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day the scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule its also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not and the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent youve been with something and that will remind you to buckle down,1
great app with an ugly widget if the widget was cleaner id give 5 stars,1
not bad if you want to install,1
love this,1
decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but i am unable to reschedule dates on the habits i have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle,1
easy to use and the alarm works great,1
addition of day counter for negative habits will be great also any option for writing notes for failures in habits will be useful and widget isnt working,1
i love it only problem i found is that you cant edit the start date once the habit is created which is a nuisance,1
good,1
4,1
please create desktop app,1
good,1
i really love the setup of this app i wish it had the ability to see weekly progress in a bullet journal style that would make it perfect for me,1
easy and practical ,1
easy to use great for creating new routines and habits,1
like the app either i havent found it or they dont have it in the free app but i would like to see a calendar with all the habits listed each day would be fun to see at the end of the month all that i did on one calendar,1
nice app quick question can i add new categories when adding my habits im not see an option only the options that came with the app is available is it that everything else must go under other please advise,1
the app is perfect for people trying to get more organized its easy to use and i use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for,1
this is a very good app just if the shopping list could be shared in watsapp would be very nice,1
why theres no option to change schedule,1
hesitant to buy premium i feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty im on a budget and if im spending 5 i certainly want more bang for my buck i wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price,1
works great,1
i like using the app and my weekly progress i would like to see a total of how many things i did each day and maybe a graph i like positive reinforcement,1
would be great to customize the alarm i want to test pavlov effect with supplements,1
great at 1st,1
alarm not working at all i have checked all settings in my phone they all are on could you please assist me on same,1
great however marking down one star as cant find a way to edit frequency of habit once youve saved it have to delete and recreate habit with new frequency,1
não tem a opçāo de sub tarefa,1
i havent started using it officially but im giving a 4 star because the user interface is on point im starting my habits on monday hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the ui thank you,1
great app how can i change the alarm sound,1
awesome app  i like the daily work and habit tracking  thanks guys,1
helped me a lot,1
i liked it i just have to many things i want to put in it and i cant afford to pay for premium,1
i like it its quite easy to use would it be possible to sync data between devices that would be a lovely plus,1
 good job,1
i liked it but once i got it i saw a had no need for it and i felt like i dont need it as much as others,1
simple and practical,1
easy to add habits and tasks you see everything for that dat,1
it s great,1
set a color which depends on percentage for goals,1
good enough,1
good app with notifications for reminding you and helping you track your progress,1
good,1
its a good app i honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes as long as there are no ads im fine i just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen that would be so convenient,1
please add an option to update habittask status from the notification bar when i receive notification on the set time overall good app,1
it is a good for organising daily task n making habit,1
handy habit helper,1
good app wish there were more customization,1
i subscribed for premium because i feel its nice could you tell me where to check the status report and how to reorganize the habits freely without any sorting order thanks edit please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average,1
very useful reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version thank you,1
quite a good app for me,1
this helped to fix my life,1
its goodwhen i install iti have many plans every day thanks for your program,1
a really nice and amazing app lots of flexibility even in the free version love it so far,1
very nice app i downloaded many app but it is the best app i love this app thanks for this app  i love this app,1

requires an ms account,0
no calendar view,0
doesnt work with non microsoft email address,0
very worst as compared to google calendar i think google calendar and your this apps to be put it in the litter bins,0
what more can i say had to change my password cause i forgot and it asks me to change my password again due to questionable activity dont want to deal with it anymore its just a darn list who gives a rats behind if someone wants to b view what im picking up for dinner they can pick it up for me if they want but not trying to come up with a whole new password so you can make me create another one 10 minutes later,0
i cant synchronize my to do list with my devices,0
i cant use my old email on my laptop and use a current email on the laptop the app will not let me use my current email and password,0
in the last update the auto update for lists across multiple devices stopped working,0
dud,0
garbage takes a simple concept and turns in to a spam generator,0
cant print after last update,0
does not work nice interface but faulty doesnt work,0
sync dont work cant invite directly and  every programmer in this world can do better than this wunderlist was a great app im very sorry for what happened to it,0
login taking so much time,0
garbage,0
no dark mode for widget,0
not ready for prime time,0
why suggest tomorrow option in widget,0
i cant create an account,0
pants,0
notes sign is in all notes all over the internet yet microsoft not fixing what does it take to fix the bug it has been a month that we have been reporting this,0
terrible im sure im not the only one saying this but ill add mine it used to be a great app as wunderlist but is now terrible i can only assume its intentional to force people elsewhere because theres some money to be made an added recent quirk is it doubling any hylerlink in the notes whenever you close the keyboard  a more insane quirk i couldnt dream up dont bother,0
1,0
update made it so that every entry has a note attached and doesnt have the ability to actually edit the note on android doesnt happen on the pc version of the app,0
multiple bugs in the andriod and windows versions no one responds to the uservoice and helpshift bug posts seems like microsoft has not invested properly in the dev team,0
forced on us as wonderlist was stolen,0
not so good,0
i miss wunderlist it was much better,0
very bad,0
anybody who selected 5 starts clearly did not ever use wunderlist but it is impossible not to make the comparison consideration for a review this company plays foul you buy out an excellent competitor for this app you are pushing and then rather than improve on it you produce something unquestionably inferior dastardly deed and regardless of your improvements there are others out there ill choose you wont get my support full stop 1 i cant add a task and have it emailed to the team member they have to keep checking todo all during the day wasting time 2 we lost the crucial comments section this allowed a team member to provide a status update or send a query this had a date and time stamp which gave a history that helped to determine the pace of work on the task it allowed the team leader to communicate easily and give feedback now we have to go to a different app like email or whatsapp to respond 3 cant sort the tasks according to team member so i gotta scroll and scroll to find all tasks i gotta talk to a team member about theres more but out of words,0
the stopped working the next day i downloaded it and got signed out and when i tried signing init said problem with my account duh,0
crashes suddenly,0
good,0
bring back wunderlist you cowardly knaves,0
if i edit something in the note then pressed back button it will save without confirmation dialog  will lost those words if it happened by accident,0
it was a huge thing i lost my data along with my account,0
why do i need an account for do to list,0
bring back wunderlist inconsistencies with being able to assign users to list some lists not identifying users who have already been added and are active on the list,0
terrible,0
appalling product,0
to hard to signin make it easier to sign in i wasnt able to sign in or use the app uninstalled,0
why isnt monday the start of the week,0
it wors fine on my phone but its terrible on my desktop not all my sub information on a tab is showing this is the united states you should not be able to put a product out if it doesnt work properly you think because were not paying for these apps you can just put anything out ,0
long time fan and user of wunderlist switched to do last year before the app was fully shut down and been mostly happy until last week when to do started deleting tasks,0
terrible experience with this my lists transferred from wunderlist which never caused me any problems and now to do keeps losing my lists so i have to reinstall all the time sort it out or im using another app,0
garbage find something else if you need to share lists with someone else,0
tasks that i want them to be daily should appear on my day spontaneously im tired of adding them every time,0
cant get it to make a sound when some one adds a something,0
doesnt work in miui 12,0
не приходят уведомления несколько устройств на разных платформах  одна и та же проблема сервис просто не работает,0
very bad app what i think but this app is wrost,0
whatever i do i wont get reminders set by me on this app i migrated from wanderlist the import of the data was very smooth but not able to use the basic feature of reminders  notification on my android phone,0
wont sync with my computer despite repeated attempts i miss wunderlist,0
нет авторизации через google,0
reminder and snooze notification arrives only when i unlock the phone useless,0
logs me out without notice,0
why am i not getting any notification none at all i even checked the notification settings,0
you should add time parameter also means if i pointed out important work of day but in important work what time i should assign and when to do should also be visible below that work not in the form of symbol but in the form of time and data get arranged according to time,0
i got this because you cant set voice reminders in cortana anymore but you cant set them in this app either confusing layout and doesnt have the functionality of a personal assistant trash,0
doesnt sync with my wife essentially as useful as notepad wanderlist was a significantly better app,0
useless since i cant put exact time for a deadline,0
needs a lot of improvement suggestion or feedback shared is waste as no one replies,0
useless,0
microsoft killed a great app wunderlist by taking out the core functionality of integrating it with calendars,0
bring back cortana,0
aak,0
not able to loginsay not login with personal accounti have only one microsoft account,0
you have to pay and install another app outlook on another machine windows only pc to be able to undelete a list mistakes will be punished,0
wunderlist was so much better i cant find a way to delete the my day and tasks feature i just want lists,0
many problems with this app,0
need an undo button,0
i cant use it for a month because email was wrong thats insane,0
reminders dont work,0
worst app ever during the import from wonderlist it removed all of my data leave it to ms to screw up a great app,0
it doesnt run on oneplus 7t pro,0
i miss wonder list to do sucks it is impossible to get anything entered without wanting to throwmy phone across the room dear microsoft screw yourself,0
its not wunderlist took a good app and ruined it just opened it up july 2020 no sync try later huh microsoft garbage,0
need be online every time start,0
terrible,0
not good,0
sign in not working,0
totally useless  sharing lists does not work,0
i installed it in m laptop and it cant even launch the program continues to crash,0
i very beginning i can easily add by tasks list ie shopping list to home screen of my mobile but know this is not working please fix the issue,0
it doesnt gives a reminder of of my tasks and planned items at all,0
sadly microsoft have a history of replacing perfectly efficient apps with less efficient ones they have purchased and killed off the immensely popularwunderlist no doubt hoping they could transfer its users to their vastly inferior product i have just give it a third try out but todo is still a 2nd ratecamel of an implementation i have been using remember the milk which is fairly excellent but will move to aoya which may suit me better,0
does job,0
since a few weeks theres a bug that adds a blank note to every item you add highly annoying as this makes actual notes no longer stand out was 5 stars before that bug though,0
struggling with a new feature that suddenly appeared where if i post a task it comes with a sticker how do i remove this,0
widget not displaying todos properly,0
home screen widget doesnt load when the phone starts,0
loved it originally but cant stand the little page icons that clutter my lists now,0
need improve 1 add the option to use gmail for flagged task 2 incorporate a pomodoro option to do the tasks 3 improve the widget appearance,0
efficient,0
i need to manage blocks of time to schedule it,0
assigning tasks to multiple users is missing which is very much needed wunder list looks much easy to work than this,0
whenever i sign it always show something went wrong plz sign in again this same problem occurs in other microsoft app also with me,0
because i though that the teams are related to this app i downloaded but i was wrong,0
reminders dont popup so i keep forgetting to do things unless your at a pc where i see outlook reminders anyway its pretty useless,0
sk aftar,0
why can i snooze only up to an hour where is a 4hour snooze option and 1day option i also cant sort tasks by reminder date most of my tasks dont have a due date but they have a reminder date i need to be able to sort by the remainder date,0
nothing more than a simple to do list without any decent widgets nobody wants to open the app every time they want to create a new task or check something they already did,0
i miss the integration with cortana used to be able to talk while driving to add a task this requires too much hand interaction even simple apps like shopping list on android allow voice input,0
please add todays task to my day automatically now it has to do it manually can you add calendar events in to do ,0
prefer wunderlist this is a sad adaptation and should have never replaced an app that worked so well,0
look so simple but not its really confused to do i ever use how can i focused when i finised 1 thing for my daily routine and still there with schedule for different day,0
notification improper or null,0
daily reminder doesnt work perfectly,0
why this so doesnt remind me,0
this app has a great ui and ux but theres one thing that really makes it useless id doesnt sync in the background so i add a tskl via desktop itll probably not show on my phone unless i open the app on my phone it makes the app risky if you need to count on your reminders another problem is the time suggestion when you create a task is always behind the keyboard and its hard to use it like that,0
it mixes todays completed task by tomorrow which is really bad experience and gives no happiness after completing a task todays completion must be removed and tomorrows list must be visible by tomorrow not today fix it,0
youd thing ms can come up with something better very basic you cant view tasks in your calendar you can specify task start and end time recurring tasks sometimes dont respawn properly,0
doesnt respect silent mode,0
repeated to do list do not appear on my day i missed few that option should have been there,0
app is great for the people who forget their tasks i will be grateful if the company adds alarm reminders in this app,0
not easy to use and doesnt do a good job of keeping reminders,0
i guess once you get the instructions you realize that a calendar app preinstalled is more effective,0
como que eu configuro uma tarefa para ser realizada todas as terças e quartas se não é possível fazer isso adicionando apenas uma tarefa precisa melhorar urgentemente,0
missing features from wunderlist might need to find a new app,0
wont sync w my crew i have to cut and paste lists wunderlist was seemless,0
sync between pc and android app is very slow wunderlist was better moving to google tasks now microsoft ruined a good thing,0
the app has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from microsoft to do directly in outlook it worked well in wunderlist but since wunderlist was transferred to microsoft to do it doesnt work anymore,0
wunderlist was better,0
does not store none tasks information well,0
great app but will have to uninstall if they dont sync with google calendar or include a calendar,0
thanks for ruining wunderlist you jackasses,0
romantic,0
cant sort via categories importance level doesnt sync well basically syncing problems all around creating new lists dont show in outlook proper,0
doesnt auto add to my day schedule wise repeat reminder doesnt work either,0
missing the widget for ios a todoreminder app is incomplete without a widget otherwise 5 stars,0
just like wunderlist except worse  laggy update of list from one device to any,0
doesnt sync well with my laptop,0
desktop widget stops functioning every minute,0
widget continues to stop working nothing shows up until i resize it,0
this is by far the best todo app i gave it 2 stars because it enforces us to use microsoft account for sharing the lists,0
completely broken for synch wunderlist actually worked this is a disaster,0
forced to review to avoid popups every few days ok so far,0
why widget is not working,0
impress me with something good that was not here during wunderlist thank you for screwing my wunderlists and making me jump through the hoops of remembering skype password,0
i m facing the i same issue which kenners79below comment on 962020 is facing widget issue,0
this app used to be good when you could add widgets that would show each task you wanted to complete on the home screen they have since removed that features and you can only add shortcuts to said custom lists might as well just use onenote now at lest that is used on my pc too,0
ui is good easy to use the only thing that bother me is that the reminder didnt work thats the basic and important feature of to do app missed many task because of this please fix it,0
apps widget still doesnt react correctly to dark mode changes i cant see the list often,0
too complicated,0
the invite user feature is horrible you can only do it through email as the text option doesnt work i used to be able to select a user in the app and they would be notified in the app i was a user of wunderlist and this is a step backwards as far as i can tell,0
cant use without a ms account improved sync widget doesnt allow you to chose which list youd like to see without going into the app,0
nice integration with teams  planner would get an extra star if i could assign tasks directly from to do,0
i have finally given up with this application although it works ok on its own not being part of outlook calendar  mail on my andoid phone is a drag if i put a to do into my calendar i like to also add it to my to do list but having to run this as a second stand alone app is far from ideal on my windows phone it was integrated into outlook as it is on the pc why isnt it part of outlook,0
another shity microlimp product they cant even copy a decent app,0
love the app as i am one of the migrated users from wanderlist but have been a bit disappointed with the following after using to do 1 option to change from task list to pure check list 2 cant install the app on my pc although it is already on my android phone,0
widgets not working in latest update,0
bring back wunderlist my list wont sync with people and im having issues,0
widget does not allow you to input to specific lists makes for a hassle to open the whole app to add milk to my grocery list,0
the notification feature doesnt work for my phone its mi note8,0
where is calender,0
a lot worse ux than wunderlist,0
all of my notifications from a day disappear if i clear one after midnight whats the point of a to do list that wont allow notifications to persist,0
please add a duedate on substep on a task,0
need ability to sort completed tasks,0
at first i liked that i could choose to see or hide the done tasks and even the done tasks were on alphabetic order i use this app also as a grocery list so every time i want to add the done tasks i have to go throw everything why cant you have the done tasks in alphabetic order as well or that we could choose between this interface and the previous one ourselves the way it is now chaotic it is very user unfriendly and time consuming,0
migrating from wunderlist but to be honest with zero integration with google calendar as wunderlist hadthis does not work for me off to todoist which has full integration really dont understand why you would close wunderlist before having the same features in todo,0
really miss wunderlist this just feels like a list of work i have to do rather than a list of possibilities from which to choose to do is a clunky pc type office app wunderlist was a fun life mobile app ill be looking for an alternative to to do,0
it was great until the latest release broke most of the useful functionality,0
also forced to move from wunderlist im missing the part on my widget where i could see todays tasks but also those for my week and the overdue tasks as well please improve,0
not as good or sleek as wunderlist i miss wunderlist,0
manwe cannot have an alarm type alert hereit brings a problem,0
برنامه خوبیه چون خیالت راحته تو گوشی ذخیره نمیشن دسته بندیش خوبه ولی نقص داره هنوز قابلیت بکاپ تو حافظه گوشی نداره اگه حواست نباشه چیزی پاک کردی قابلیت برگشت نداره و مقداری نسبت به نسخه کلاسیک مقداری دیر لود میشه,0
reminders sometimes dont work especially if set through browser on desktop or if we edit description after setting the reminder,0
i really like this app but i dont like microsoft i have gotton locked from this app so many times,0
its not as nice as wunderlist was,0
the app is good and useful with great features it has everything that you need for a basic to do list app but the reason for my 3 stars is that the widget is broken,0
i really cant change notification sound and it uses the same phone notification,0
i think that if it was linked to a calender it would be perfect,0
back button doesnt shut down application,0
widget doesnt load upon phone restart on samsung s20 fe it fixes itself once i load the app outside of that this is a great app,0
i hoped it have a timetable something,0
great app for managing your activities helped me alot but there is some issues like the notifications doesnt always shows and reminds me that i have to do the task,0
new user,0
please add an oled friendly dark colour scheme to the widgets,0
its good,0
it stops working in between times sometimes it stops reminding me about my tasks and sometimes it does please fix this,0
please unify gui and workflow of planner and to do,0
it serves the purpose but its not exactly what i want in the way of organization,0
thank you ,0
good,0
please allow me to set due time also instead of just due date,0
it was working all good until the recent update i use it on a split screen on a tablet previously the left hand side list bar was automatically hidden if the screen is small now it always stays which means the task list on the right is impossible to read,0
its very helpful,0
i like it but it started putting a note icon below each item i add to the list it makes the item box twice as tall and its super annoying,0
it a decent basic app for what i need my only current issue is that the height of each task box way too much white space on each individual task,0
can it show the schedule into calendar view,0
so sad that wunderlist must gone will this one expect the expectation why i cant open to do in web browser,0
there should be a note keeping feature,0
sync not happen properly in time  takimg longer time  pc and mobile  and attachtment of picture not showing thumblail preview ,0
best,0
please make widget more cool,0
shame that when someone is creating a task there is no notification to the person this task is assigned to,0
please fix the android bug whereby every new item added gets a note added too  very annoying,0
bug some items without notes show in the list with the note icon underneath on ios the same list correctly doesnt show any note icon,0
microsoft has screwed up a really good app,0
why to do auto add the notes in all tasks,0
microsoft can do better,0
i have two problems 1if i am offline and application is closed then on my android 70 app do not works 2i am unable to disable vibrationi do not founded in options menu please help,0
decent it would be good to add custom notifications,0
app is good sticky notes would have make it more usefull,0
its good once you figure it out,0
latest gripe repeating tasks have started appearing on the prior calendar day rather than the proper repeating due day but not always very weird,0
pretty useful if you sign in to your account you can see the same information on your windows computer,0
need more user friendly interface,0
sync is a bit slow widget does not update very quickly either otherwise smooth interface and no other issues,0
i set reminder for a particular time but it reminds me at some different time than the one i set and my phone always connected to internet i wish this issue could be sorted out,0
mejorando,0
just started using this app its nice you can connect others to view you to do list,0
whats the point if the reminder alarm goes off only when i open the app it doesnt send notifications,0
good but cant share my lists,0
i would prefer the ability to sync my tasks with google calendar,0
all in al its a good app but for the last couple of months the reminders arent working no push notifications are received i checked all my permissions for this app and power settings but cant see anything that would prevent it from pushing notifications any ideas,0
bell sound is missing when i click completed in widget mode,0
egg,0
layout is horrible give me a simple list view and the ability to hide the tacky theme,0
so far so good,0
widget doesnt support other list besides my day 5 star if functionality is added,0
i cant select multiple images to add to a list its as if the option is there but not implemented  says i have 1 image selected but im not able to select another one simultaneously,0
i still wish it had a more unique name than todo like at least wunderlist 20,0
google calendar is better than it,0
nice app,0
ok,0
meh,0
seen nice so far,0
its great but should have some option to put my own photos on background,0
good for daily too list but not much more,0
very helpful but will be more if you can add time management matrix from eisenhower please think of this feature,0
everything is fine except the notification doesnt ring untill i open the app by myself and that is so irritating what will be the moto of reminders if they cant remind you properly,0
good app,0
good app at what it does i think theres some functionality readily available in other apps that would greatly improve this one im no programmer so maybe theres a reason they cant include it,0
great app please add a streak counter for repetitive tasks,0
nice app but still needs more improvement,0
please please please add the option for duplicating tasks im using it for an operational purpose where i have to re do task listing from scratch everything else seems fine i used to use wunderlist and the duplicate feature is the best feature in it please add it soon,0
not getting notifications on my samsung device assignments that are shared do not alert me once the task is completed by the other party,0
its good,0
require notification and messaging features in the app,0
please tell how to get a audible alarm after setting date and time in reminder without an audible alarm at set date and time for any task this app is of no use to me,0
fairly limited,0
last app wunderlist is better than this beacuse if we make list under folder with defferent folders and see list under widgets we can see only list without folder it makes me disturbe in wunderlist we can see list under folder in widgets so that i like that app please solve it,0
less pastit notes thanks,0
would love it if the tasks had an option of being hidden once completed otherwise i would rate 5stars,0
falta muita coisa,0
good app but could be better,0
doesnt sync with my phone app,0
just started using it so far so good may change rating after using it for awhile,0
it is good but it should remind us to do the tasks,0
enjoying so far i am sure there are more capabilities i am yet to discover makes life so much easier,1
simple app for simple tasks,1
app is really good but if you forget microsoft pwd is a huge pain to reset it,1
great,1
its great for keeping track of a busy life need collaboration opportunities within the program to allow for communicating with others on what they didu,1
very good app for everyone,1
app is very useful however it works slow on my macbook,1
occasional issues with synchronizing lists but otherwise great,1
great but need to add some feature such as privacy with fingerprint or face lock,1
please add feature that let me switch between lists by swiping right and left in list page thank you so much for this great app ,1
convenient and great,1
the scheduled reminders doesnt work the app notifies you only the first time,1
great but we need be able to set my day list a night before,1
this apps makes it easier to organise your day and goals with daily reminders and it is a fun app because you get to customize the themes of each goal,1
please make the mobile and desktop version like the web version its cleaner and more simple,1
needs comment option on each task,1
good,1
good,1
good,1
add copy task with sub tasks to clipboard also reorder subtasks sometimes broken urgent ,1
just using know exploring more,1
great app for all my to do lists there are just minor issues in syncing sometimes,1
its good but wish google assistant would add to it,1
great app but if scheduled time more than 2 weeks it make it better,1
its alright,1
helpful app though some times doesnt update when someone else adds items bot not a frequent issue,1
simple to use and works great so far just wish that scheduled tasks could be shared with the calendar as an option,1
allow reminders to pop up all in all its ok,1
still to work out the kinks,1
nice app but complicated setting are there at some points but this is best app  i ever used in to do works,1
simple to use,1
nice for productivity,1
easy to use,1
very useful app,1
nada mal,1
easy to use,1
this is not reminding me even though i set an remainder option,1
i use a daily for tasks and lists there could be one more subcategorysublist it would be nice to show pictures in line too,1
well structured,1
great,1
its a nice but i personally need a full screen pop up its convenient for me personally,1
item duplicate automatically,1
slow to open needs an option to list in order of oldest task first great overall,1
great app,1
a search function in completed items would increase the stars to 5,1
great for getting tasks from phone to pc not so good at understanding long lists on phone,1
very good app,1
nice app,1
it would be great if we could have geographic reminders like when you drive home and it will remind you,1
convenient,1
great,1
microsoft is great at listening to reviews i still miss wunderlist but to do is close,1
6 xz,1
keeps me organized,1
excellent app for sharing tasks across family members would give it more stars if it worked as the task app for outlook,1
very good for managing tasks and very efficient in collaborating with others,1
great organizational tool i use it every day,1
works well with office products,1
great app thank you microsoft,1
fine app would be better if we could sync it with other apps as well,1
simple and neat wish it could let me add priority on tasks and allow me to reorder the tasks within planned tab,1
good,1
needs more work notes are awkward maybe what i want is something simpler,1
i think the app with a time table for sorting tasks will become more useful ,1
awesome and esay to use,1
good app that syncs with outlook widget needs transparent options,1
they should give some type of sound feedback when u finish a task,1
very good,1
please add time stamps and ranking to sub tasks in each task,1
this app is so good but can be better on remainder,1
i like this app,1
excellent app but please add recyclebin in the app,1
very good,1
very nice app using it regularly to get reminders,1
it is a real time management tool,1
the worst thing is its not integrated with one drive to attach or edit file,1
good,1
i would like a more in depth prioritization system beyond a star thinking the quadrants from the 7habits of highly effective people,1
shopping grocery listsapointmentson all devices to update and edit when you think of it,1
good application,1
great to do list waiting for new features eg notes should have a comment section with timestamp,1
useful with good ui,1
very good app and easy to use,1
great app but need to add mark complete check,1
nice,1
very good app for day to day planning,1
please add option to sort by reminder time,1
helps to become more productive not using ai or recommendation engines,1

از حیث ابعاد مختلفی کامله مثل امکان گروه بندی امکان آپلود فایل امکان ساخت ساب تسک تنظیم سر رسید تنظیم یادآور امکان شیر وعهدهگذاری کارها به علاوه محیط بسیار کاربر پسند تنها مشکل اینه برای سابتسکها نمیتوان تاریخ سر رسید و عهدهگذاری داشت و میزان و نحوه روند انجام کار امکان نمایش ندارد  برای دوستان لازم میدونم بگم بین محیط ویندوز و اندروید به خوبی همگام سازی میشه و همچنین هر تقویمی که دستگاه روش نصب باشه رو نمایش میدهیعنی برای ویندوز ۱۰ تقیم کامل جلالی,1
very good use app,1
would be more effective if there was an option to add reminders for subtasks and option to add time deadline along with due date,1
i like the app easy to use and organize i just wished there was a way to turn the spell check off in it its miserable trying to type noneuropean style names in it,1
amazing app i am very happy to follow my tasks jobs etcamazing appbut i want the developers to keep an option which will continue everyday the same tasks it would be nice i have to always write my tasks daily,1
its very useful for the all,1
love it helps me to stay organized so mych more love the detailed features as well,1
if have difference label or icon can be used then is better,1
ok,1
very useful app ,1
app keeps asking for access to other apps we high i do not want to permit,1
the app is near perfect it has just one flaw for me adding pictures or files or other attachments why do i need to be online to add files to a reminder please make attaching files available offline to add an extra layer of convenience,1
very useful,1
its nice,1
great,1
its easy to use and perfect for all my lists,1
top notch easy to use and manage tasks or projects the reminders dont send full notifications quite often so a little bug to work on there,1
fairly easy to use very useful for shopping lists and to do lists,1
its overall very nice but small things keep frustrating me one particular thing is why cant you add reminders for custom days why pick a specific day,1
so far from my user experienceswitch from any doalready good  keeps getting better every update thank microsoft team,1
great app simultaneously connects to desktop,1
add memo with overlapping facilities of diff memos,1
amazing,1
it would be nice if you could color code tasks otherwise a very good app,1
es muy completo para lo que necesito,1
easy to use  one additional feature you can add is to provide an option in themes where we can set some inspiring quotes from our gallery,1

awesome and multi device sharing,1
easy to keep yourself organised and prioritise your todos,1
absolutely astonishing,1
love this app and office 365 in general,1
the new update brings a lot that was desired most importantly list sharing with much better approach than wunderlist but task assigning within the shared list and chat on a particular task is still missing and this is something that still holds me back from fully migrating from wunderlist,1
best of the best,1
very nice app must try,1
awesome,1
the best thing to type and remember our list,1

couldnt figure out why there was a gray line in addition to the red line showing the hour also all day events show as a small sector instead of the entire circle looking at a regular calendar is still easier,0
helps me somehow,0
why is it being linked with my google calendar or phone calendar i dont want this private app to access my google calenders and phone calender instead you should have just added the feature of adding tasks within the app im deleting this the ui is great but i dont want you to link with my private apps,0
it cannot work by itself and its not userfriendly,0
does not detect my devices calendar device default app but instead asks me to download a calendar,0
bad,0
i dont know why this app is hard to understand  i have seen many positive comments and thats why i installed it but this is complicated or may be i want something else which this app doesnt offer,0
hard to control make this app easy to control its eating my head,0
i dont really liked it much  waste of intenet,0
is there a way to add events directly  i dont want to sync it with calendarit is very time consuming,0
the settings dont work well and its really confusing when it doesnt function at all ,0
might be a good app but complicated to use,0
not what i thought it was this only blocks out time for your calendars i was looking for something that would help with daily routines  i even tried to use the calendar before giving up but it refused to sync so its useless,0
really frustating configuration,0
in this app it is very hard to use,0
no es intuitiva,0
puts all info in default google calendar,0
lnot friendly interface,0
it gives the option to add a local calendar but doesnt let you use it unless you also give permission to use a google or outlook calendar kind of defeats the purpose of doing a localonly calendar if i cant actually use it,0
its really hard to shedule,0
not felt user friendly,0
vvvvbad,0
instalei de novo e não mudou muito minha ideia quero um calendário e não uma ferramenta pra integração com o calendário do google tá de sacanagem,0

want to customize colors buy the pro version not a chance thanks for nothing b,0
24 hour mode is a pro feature,0
bought the paid version the app fails to get data from anything except gmail good concept but lacks in across provider connectivity,0
i cant synchronized to my calendar,0
only certain google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless a great idea that is flawed in execution,0
wew,0
i just bought pro on my tablet 15 minutes ago and then installed sectograph on my phone and it says i have to buy pro again what the heck happened with syncing google accounts,0
great idea but doesnt show all events for the day doesnt show events in designated colours all look the same doesnt show repeat events no use really im removing it from my phone,0
this is very good,0
difficult to understand bit complicated,0
just an unwanted extension of calendar,0
poor interface,0
not good,0
hard to use if we could make some changes just by sliding the clock or smthn that would be awesome,0
its too complicated,0
love this app got the pro version it will save a lot of my cognitive work please fix this bug the colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the sub calendar overall the app needs better ux design wrt the complex menu for customization and some other things eg it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars but in terms of functionality it is awesome,0
where is the alarm tone setting in this,0
i dont understand anything its super complicated,0
this app is good but the setting is not understandable  i might not even give it a single star,0
its a good app but there should be downloadble templates since it would take time and a lot harder to create your own design,0
did not work on my amazon fire 8 app just flashed abou a mile a minute and nothing could be selected,0
useless app to startwith,0
worked for 2 days now i cant enter anything i enter date time description hit save it says saved but nothing shows up on the lo k dial thingy too bad nice oncept tho,0
okay,0
there is an issue in syncing and the events are lost in few mins post adding it the app could have had their own calendar without syncing to android calendar please improvise,0
not even a trial,0
very bad  dont download very complicated app,0
bad,0
complicated,0
how the app is representing there features were not like that  we need to buy them all ,0
i dont like this,0
it just dont work the way i thought it would not what i expected,0
not good,0
not all calendars are showing up in sync calendar list events created arent appearing,0
isnt easy to use and it tries to sync with my calendar which defeats the purpose of tracking my personal time,0
i hate that its connect to google calendar please make this optional or take it out all together,0
i have not been able to get this app to work i bought the upgraded version and that didnt change any of my abilities to sync calendars right now it gets a 25 stars because it is virtually useless i will update after i reinstall,0
this might be a good app i didnt get to use it because the only way to use is it is to open it with a calendar app i uninstalled the app because of that reason,0
dont wanna have to use a second party app just get my schedules on the planner,0
shouldnt be this complicated n it mess up the existing calender events,0
widget out of memory,0
romantic,0
not easy to use quite complicated for just adding a lunch break ect sets events from your calendar might as well use that instead,0
wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar i wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible disappointing,0
wish it didnt force me to use google calendar i wanted to start a new calender off of this app,0
no adding option for the time,0
great idea in principle but its so hard to work out whats going on that that so far its useless ,0
i really like how amazing it is on my phone but im so disappointed to see that it cant be downloaded or visualized on my new galaxy active watch,0
sync is not good,0
never tried it yet,0
not in sync with my google account bad in regards to automatically getting what i planned and plus i cant use it when i am using my pc but thumbs up for this sectogragh the idea is brilliant please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to reenter all my days task and activities it should be able to get data from my google account and i should be able to use it on pc pc is really perfect use for this kind of app,0
not that good after using,0
it does not ync eith al the calendars,0
i downloaded it but dont know how to use it really messed up app,0
couldnt exactly figure out how to use it,0
the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it very annoying,0
not a fan  liked the idea of diving into main areas and percentage of your day it occupates but what flipped me up was scheduling a reminder  daily i started getting a morning reminder of the task for the next day schedule for ie 7pm i mean what about task i have for this day ahead i dont need to be notified 27hrs ahead of my daily rutine  seriously,0
when adding a task it transferring you to google calendar then after adding the event it doesnt appear on the widget,0
acceptable,0
good,0
,0
i like this app but its always saying it has stopped on my phone,0
not good,0
it only works when linked to another calendar appand its difficult to change the time from am to pm,0
does not sync with ms exchange calendar,0
very confusing when problems occur the resolution isnt made clear,0
i couldnt sync this with my work email and doesnt seem to give me the option to,0
could not get app to consistently stay connected to my google calendars,0
i love the idea but there are syncing issues  events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar  they show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same  also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day  i have something starting at 1230 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else  its confusing,0
just works with google calendar cant use it without it uninstalled,0
not working properly on redmi note 4,0
stupid app,0
purchased app palette when i try to use it app stops every time,0
graphics,0
doesnt seem to work on samsung note 2,0
may be good for you but i cant comment further,0
is there a way to set times without syncing if i set a daily morning task for example then it will clutter my other calendars with that task if theres no way to set it so that i can do daily time schedules without clutter then itll have to be 3 from me,0
i deleted it i dont want to use my calendar,0
good so far,0
good getting to know,0
difficult to use,0
google  drive app intrall,0
good but unless you pay you cant enjoy the good stuff,0
very useful app but need alram feature too,0
nice even cute but it turns out i dont use it so much cause it uses my private google calendar,0
nice app,0
i like this app but would like to see future dates to see any conflicts in schedule would be nice to have some font size selection in widget no matter how big you make the widget it can be hard to read for those with less than perfect vision,0
dont like that i can only add items through the calendar i dont put everything on the calendar thats on my todo list,0
confusing for me but several friends enjoy it,0
my app doesnt show reminder on the screen previously it was showing which settings shall i change plz guide,0
good but very buggy,0
yeah,0
would give a 5 star if it worked on my galaxy watch need more detailed instructions cant find it on my watch,0
is this have an alarm mode,0
what if i dont want it to use internal calendar,0
howd u adjust an event duration ,0
this app look cool on the screen but it was hard to figure out how to use it the could be more settings added to the app so people can make it more direct for their life,0
hey will there be no reminder function on this app,0
this app would be so amazing if you add  repeat weekly2 weeks  feature  we would then be able to use it as a time table  please ,0
i wanted to use this apps independently of calendar the apps is well done but it comes as a doublon of calendar and it become not useful for me,0
it worked fine but after android 9 latest updates it fails to update the widget and have to open the app to do the same,0
good,0
its been good cant complain,0
nice,0
drain too much my battery,0
its good but not that much because after completing the tasks they didnt appear in the list it must be in one frame at a place down in the list  secondly it doesnt provide u the notifications properly it just ring like a bell that is for a single second,0
still learning to use app,0
usable,0
not user friendly,0
what is this  next alarm sysyem update,0
average app,0
felt very complicated when i am flying high,0
this just displays your calendar as a time sector whenever you click on  it redirects to calendar,0
lot of difficult methods to organize,0
best app to mannage your time,0
it is useful but very user friendly,0
its a cool way of getting at a glance your schedule the theme could be more colorful,0
good idea but i cannot connect it with my smartwatch,0
it is difficult to set an event or goal without a tutorial,0
good,0
i dont friggin know yet i just installed it note i havent spent any time on it,0
i do not understand how i will add events i tried adding events but it only shows up in my calendar not at the sectograph it seems to be useful but i need to know how to make it work,0
im liking it but it seems to have some bugs its currently 0113am but the widget and app are still showing yesterdays calendar sectors and event list,0
just a fancy calender widget sure it looks fancy but it doesnt add any functionality it cant do much else it cant track progress,0
i love the design and the app in general i would give it 5 stars if it would allow to size the image and the information displayed,0
great app,0
everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app,0
too tricky complicated not immediate maybe isnt what i needi need something more simple,0
good app but need improvement,0
its a nice app liked the design also no option to copy paste same schedule to next day,0
still trying,0
average features,0
i uninstalled because the app was a little confusing it has a great idea and all bit i just didnt quite get how to use it,0
great app just need one thing is second hand also like minutes and hours the i will 5 star and its best app,0
needed a standalone platform which does not connect to any of my calendars,0
really great concept but not much useful and not even that beautifully eyecatching thing,0
i really like the visual round of this app however i would love to be able to personalise it more easily,0
it s good,0
good so far only used a few times may review later on,0
its ok,0
its an interesting tool but having one or 2 things on my calendar per day it does really make sense for me to use it looks nice,0
i dont like to put on google calendar every schedule,0
app is great but the events are not getting created  only one two events for a day is created than even it shows created its not,0
i wouldve liked to use this app but sadly it doesnt seem to recognize european daylight saving time ive gone through the settings twice this is a deal breaker im afraid i would still recommend people try the app however if the live in location where dst is rightfully ignored the main concept is really clever and the widget is beautifully designed ,0
wish i could add events without having anything to do with google calendar,0
cant get demo to play its probably a great app,0
looks cool but i do not find it actually helpful unless you write down everything you do every hour every day,0
sorry i dont get it i have no idea why seeing my schedule on a circle is somehow better than a rectangle what am i missing,0
awesome app,0
it would be much better with an ability to have a report at the end of the month as to what was worked on and when ie statistics,0
okk,0
time zones not supported missed a meeting today ,0
not as i required,0
its db un to use,0
fine,0
ok but need to improve,0
not bad,0
still want to go thoroughly with this app,0
any way to resize font so short events can still have a complete or at least longer than 2 words display,0
cool idea woupd be good if it could access my outlook calendar,0
pls add 24 hour view,0
its great i love it,0
recommend,0
after the recent update displays alarms an hour earlier than they actually are been using the app for more than a year now and love it,0
how do i see all events and other day events instead of only today within 12h only is this what you mean by 24h clock in pro will it also show other days with pro i like the app but some things ar not very clear to me thanks,1
great app love the layout,1
wish it could sync with google task  ,1
saya bisa manage waktu saya mantep tp harga pro mahal nih diskon dong,1
its good app to use,1
very nice app any chance tasks and reminders can be integrated into the display as well,1
extremely helpful for a visual thinker like me but the pallette settings are confusing and should be the same for all watch faces having different colors in the app and in the widget and on the watch face is distracting and confusing,1
not very easy to navigate the settings,1
love this app i have always thought of time on a clock face and this just makes so much more sense to me than the list of things you get in google calendar and other organisational apps my only suggestion for improvement would be more colour customisation of the segment events and the option to link a segment to a checklist i have found a way to do this but it means i need to use a url link to redirect it to said list and that takes an extra click and is a bit fiddly to set up,1
great app,1
great app love how it learns abt my events and notifies me accordingly,1
its an amazing app it shows us how much time we take for homeworks and etc this is really useful app for me hope you get the same experience,1
i recommended this app to everyone because its very useful app especially for students like me,1
very good app,1
good to have this as my memo,1
very good app helped me a lot,1
love this app,1
just started to use this app seems helpful so far,1
0,1
helpful,1
good but confusing for new user,1
smart app help your organised your daily tasks,1
its very helpful,1
im using a free version and it works very well keeps me up to date,1
nice app,1
recommend to try it 4 starts as nothing is perfect not because it isnt good enough,1
good step learning curve,1
does exactly what it said it would,1
very nice and innovative calander app only one thing is multiple widget like squre and rectangle also widget event font was very small there should be option to increase font size to proper visibilityalso it show next event instead of curren event thanks,1
good apk,1
great really helps me visually percieve all my tasks with time wish the interphase was more customizable tho,1
i love this app i just wish that there was an internal calendar in it so that i didnt have to create and turn on a calendar in google calendars in order to receive alerts for events in sectograph,1
im still looking forward to its impacts at this point,1
excelente aplicação boa integração com google calendar e facilita a gestão do dia e da semana parabéns aos desenvolvedores,1
im still trying to figure out all out im unsure if i want to buy the upgrade but i like the idea of it,1
really like this app,1
interesting alternative to combined calendars and notes very visual approach that allows to focus on what matters time is a scarce and unvaluable commodity lets manage it as it should ,1
good app,1
glitches with all day events in outlook,1
good app,1
love this app all time basedentire day events in visually streamlined view,1
its ok but i cant put the clock onto my home screen,1
its good can still be improved looking forward to it,1
very useful,1
its really smart idea to see at a glance from your homescreen all your planned activities,1
good,1
this is good app and it has a beutiful widget,1
nice layout,1
easy to use love the format and widget format as well works perfect for my frienfs business that i work for i can help him get and stay organized and were less likely to forget important things i love how i can organize the scedule and set reminders while im at home relaxing and he can instantly have it on his phone as well barely any adds which is awesome great app for what i use it for and im sure it can be great for alot of different situations ,1
its really a great app to organize your life good experience ,1
i love this app but sadly it does not work with active 2 watch imagine the possibilities if you could have this widget on a wearable ,1
nice,1
excellent,1
good app but i cant get it to shade in the entire timeframes of my activities like in the photos here it only has a line at the end time,1
love love love this app but you guys can add some more features to make it a bit more easier to use,1
good app,1
id say its great,1
good visualisation would be great if the widget came in a dark version as well and transparency could be set,1
this is a good apps but i think it will be better if the widget will show in the lockscreen too so it will be easier to check the plan but offer all this is a good apps still find no problem up till now maybe ill try the premium version to see the more features,1
it is a nice application,1
annoying that you cant change the color background of the dial with the free version but otherwise very useful and fun to use,1
wish for larger text difficult to read,1
this is good application for the procrastinators who usually wasted their time on phone without any reason i like the sectograph because it let me push to do the work of hat makes any sense so i recommend you to use this application ,1
i like the graphic,1
useful but still needs more integration to outlook  id like to load my colour categories that i already have in outlook calendar in my visualization calendar by week numbers is also a must have  id like to know also the percentage of availability of each day based on my events it could also integrate with my alarm in order to know at what time i wake up  and so on the potential of this app is huge,1
very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule,1
it takes some getting used to but then when you start thinking of it as an analog watch it sort of works,1
really like it would love to be able to manually resize appointments and add new appointments into arcs with free time,1
enjoying it so far,1
good android widget for watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen  for syncing all calenders to view birthdays  events at one place,1
i really like this app i find the the way it presents the data in a clock face with countdowns to your events very useful the one drawback for me is that it doesnt integrate with google tasks or reminders this means that everything you want to see needs to be created as an event this is not a massive deal but i do like the convenience of tasks over events the widget sometimes loses synchronisation with the clock and shows a different time than the actual time,1
just please add reminders  notifications with custom sound  and more colors  and please make the wedge icon display description of the event or auto degrease the letters size to fit more than 1 word or add a fieldnto type title that will be shownedited in the app even it comes from another planner without titles ,1
love it just need galaxy watch face even paid fair price,1
great app,1
excellent work,1
functional,1
classic,1
quite helpful for daily tasks,1
a birds eye view to your schedule,1
its nice and helpful,1
excellent planner,1
its very good,1
the app is real good and helps in improving the productivity an improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar it is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event,1
nice app,1
great app to track your daily schedule one thing what would be great to have here  displaying the scheduled reminders from google calendar unfortunately i do not see them,1
really fun view of your day still figuring out how to use it well it would be nice for the widget palette to also be visible inside the app but its not a huge issue i could easily see myself changing to 5 stars once i get used to it,1
good app,1
nice app quite original,1
it gives a nice visual look at the day,1
needs improvement,1
its a neat app,1
good app but need to something more,1
very good app helps me stay organized,1
very nice app and easy to use,1
overall impressive app but it does not updated in real time always showing delayed time until manual update,1
i started using this app in 11th std  im getting its benifit but the only thing is that it doesnt shows the tasks we have to complete in some monutes or if two tasks are to be completed simultaneously in a hour so i humbly request to make some more changes in this app so that everyone can use it more comfortably,1
ok,1
nice,1
useful,1
this app is very helpful but you need to control yourself to done schedule on time,1
lot more easy and practical maintaining calendar is funloved the widget,1
i love this widget its such a clear picture of the time and schedule my only thing is i wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch i got the app because i saw it on the watch im the pictures but it doesnt work with the galaxy watch  if this was improved to work with the watch i would give it 5 stars,1

a very good pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side im not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today my whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45 looking as faded blue and nothing else was there i also have screen shot of the error if developers need it else its a great app soon will buy the pro version,1

im still trying it out but so far it has helped a lot one would not waste time if they have this app in hand,0
the app was awesome but it stopped working in a week im not able to add any routine now,0
its usefull  but would be much nicer if there was an option to play a notification tone just once instead of repeating it continuously,0
hi thanks for responding and ill be more specific please bring back the pretty orange background for the top bar and each of the routines the current color is too pale,0
really like this app but wish i could see my whole calendar or at least have the option to search for a specific date that would make it perfect as i want to use it as my go to planner,0
good,0
good,0
its serves a purpose,0
critical,0
its ok,0

it would be better if there is an option in which we are able to check whether we really followed time table or not ,0
gets me moving when i get a reminder,0
nice app,0
great concept,0
the layout for the app is awesome but it would be better if nonroutine task can be added into the timeline with the same activity for routine task,0
i love this app so far but the notifications are not really working for me,0
good app,0
i love this app i would really love an option to check off or mark that a task was complete,0
not too bad,0
it is useful but not the perfect,0
im sure the pro version is great but it didnt keep my interest long enough,0
its simple and easy to use but notification often doesnt work about 10 times a day,0
sometimes it stops working so you have to refresh the background tasks but its a nice app,1
good apphelps you keep track of your schedule well,1

очень хорошее и удобное приложение,1
op bolte,1
very very very very very very very very very very very very very helpful app,1
best app for planning and to make us follow it,1
you have to pay extra to continue after a free trial,0
why have i been logged out and cant reset my password to get back in,0
id love to use this app if there was any other payment method than with a credit card which i dont have and dont want,0
its not free,0
downloaded free trial and looked at it first day and it wasnt really easy to use so didnt look at it again i had no correspondence from them to tell me that the trial was over and that they were going to take the money i find that deceptive behaviour as they are banking o people forgetting to cancel,0
hate,0
tried to put in my first event and it failed to log it i uninstalled it same day,0
impossible to use,0
my events show up at the wrong time in my calendar even when theyve been manually entered whats the point of a planner that doest let you plan,0
only option is paid subsctiption app no thanks i cant constantly pay for apps within my budget so id much rather have the option to use a version with ads,0
app install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks so you have to pay to use this app this is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install,0
could you make an option to not stop the trial because i dont think some people want to do the trial and it doesnt mention that before you download the app and when you do you guys get paid,0
it wouldnt let me try the app it just told me to subscribe,0
you cant even try it out they are automatically asking you to pick a subscriber plan before you can even see a calendar or anything,0
this is a pay to play calendar only,0
i just signed up and i cant even access anything keeps saying error code 7,0
i was interested in this app until i had to put in my credit card for a free trial without even knowing the price,0
dont like not being able to even look at the app without credit card entry and account sign up,0
i really like the apponline portal but having everything in one does me no good wo push notifications  i wish this had a widget so i didnt have to open the app to look at everythingi paid for this  i dont feel like i got my investment back as i maybe use the app once in a blue moon it looks great but it just doesnt work to what i feel is its full protein i hope you add this  dont make me pay for it,0
there is a subscription to the service i wish i would have knownbefore i downloaded looks beautiful though,0
its ok,0
so far i love the layout and look im not giving it 5 yet but will update as i use it more i dont like that if i click on my notification that it opens the event to save or delete i stead of just looking at it or giving me the option to complete my other issue is not being able to change the time i want an all day reminder again i love it so far but would like to see that changed,0
why cant i get it to open up on my chromebook it stays in a phone formatso disappointed,0
it would be good if it was a free app i understand in app purchases but only if the app itself was free,0
love your hard work but its there a widget with the calendar open,0
love it so far wish it had a widget for android though,0
i had just downloaded the app on my phone and wasnt able to log in on my pc i contacted customer service who we were quick to answer and very friendly having used it i am pretty much in love it makes me feel like i am holding a paper planner in my hands the only thing i would want to add is a place to log my physical activities other than that i am in love,1
really enjoying using this planner and now my lists and tasks can repeat it is slowly replacing my old calendar and todo apps altogether,1
i really like this app so far ive been using it a week now and it does everything i need it to do i normally use the astaire bullet journal method with a rolling weekly task list but im still able to make a weekly task list and assign tasks to certain days i can also migrate the ones that dont get done i will certainly keep this app and dont mind the subscription because it works so well for me ill check back in again in a few weeks,1
i really really like it simple to use and it seems to be syncing ok love the colors and how it looks in my windows 10 browser look forward to updates like new stickers in the future,1
love the look of this agenda list feature is great way to track  complete to do lists,1
i love the concept  look of this mobile app  the desktop version i wish i could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks you also cant set reminders if you add an event directly into artful agenda you have to add it to your google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to artful agenda ive paid for the year subscription  im really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or i wont be renewing,1
so far i really like it when will the stickers and tablet features be ready,1
just installed love that syncs with google wish the mobile app allowed screen rotation wish i could zoom on the week a month view i understand mobile i in beta looking forward to the evolution,1
so far so good,1
love it i hope we get more stickers but its great,1
your life will be changed by this app i have always used paper planners ive also used digital planners i also have my digital calendars this app takes all of those platforms and makes a beautiful pastry you need a list theyve got lists and stickers really its a no brainer,1
user friendly all the things i look for in a paper agendanow on my phone,1
tip top customer service great just a bit expensive,1
i stumbled upon this site as an ad popped up on my instagram feed normally i would scroll past but something caught my eye and im so very glad that i followed the link  i signed up instantly as i too have been searching for something less mundane and more customisable than google calendar and this meets all my expectations just perfectly i am telling all my friends and just bought my mum a subscription for her birthday as shell love it thank you for inventing it youve made my year,1
the best agenda ever love this app,1
this is a fantastic app and well worth the money i have been using it now for 2 months and it has replaced my paper planner i never thought that would be possible if youre debating on getting it they have a free trial period to help show how amazing it truly is,1
i really like this app and im stoked to hear about upcoming updates that will be game changing this app is just what im looking for a functional and attractive agenda to replace my physical planner,1

i love this calendar app this is the only digital calendar that i have been happy with i can easily see what i have coming up i love the tasks and the ability to make my to do list right on the appand the ability to easily snooze a task ii didnt get to until tomorrow love it,1
always missing the notifications even when it is not optimized and restricted in background,0
i wish there was a way to save what is in it to be backed up to email,0
everything is okay but it doesnt notify on time i missed an important event because of this bug ive used other apps on play store and all of them have the same problem some of them dont notify when the screen is locked none of them are perfect at times the app notifies me only after i open it,0
as i am a regular user of this appthis app needs some update like the calendar based listing method people will go to date and list the taskanother problem is so many color for list its annoying who dont like colors they can select one color for every task list that is all,0
this is really great app,1
helps to keep on track thanks,1

i used to use this app for years but it does not sync on oneplus 7t android 10 i have to sync on google calendar first to update events on this app,0
somehow just cleared my entire schedule,0
i loved using this calender app to keep track of all my appointments until it suddenly deleted them all in the middle of my work day  now im screwed,0
broke widget on fold 2 widget is stretched and distorted,0
junk app,0
i purchased this app once but for sone reason i now have the free version whats up with that,0
does not sync not worth it to miss meetings force synced does not typically refresh back to google calendar sync is a big part of being a calendar app,0
works fine but the ads are horrible every time i enter something new i have to watch a slow ad im removing it,0
recently a ridiculous amount of advertising has been added to this app  im unable to add appointments while i wait for the ad that covers the whole screen to finish i can no longer use this as its affecting my business it has been a good calendar for years but i will be deleting it asap update  the developer responded  said that an ad appears only every 18 hrs this is incorrect an ad appears after every diary entry  other times too i enter multiple entries every day so get many ads,0
whos brilliant idea was to add several holidays which you cant even delete that are not even us federal holidays to this calendar,0
this apps reminder is always late always late i dont know if there is a problem in my setting but im really not enjoying this app i really dont i thought this app will help me big thumbs down ,0
nope nope nope,0
bad avoid,0
i used this calander app for years and found it to be excellent but recently it started playing full page video ads making accessing information on the fly unreliable im sure the paid version is still great but i cant recommend using this as a free calander app anymore,0
paid for premium and now i keep getting ads after the update,0
doesnt sync well and has left me out of meetings,0
used to love this app and originally gave it 5 stars it has stopped sinking with my phone for about 6 or more months but functioned perfectly on my phone however for the last couple of weeks my appointment reminders only function occassionally ive gone through the settings on both devices and cant find anything wrong i have reinstalled the app several times but nothing helps i can no longer reccomend this app,0
does not sync with tablet,0
i really liked the app but now im going to have to find something else they have started to have pop up ads that are very disruptive i was in a meeting and i had to put in an event in the calendar when an ad popped up and started blaring music and i couldnt close it until the ad was finished it was very inappropriate it is now totally unsuitable for a business calendar with these ads i was fine before when the ads were unobtrusive,0
its just a basic normal calendar nothing special about it but now for some reason it no longer shows holidays not even the kost common known ones world wide such as christmas or even new years,0
zסב,0
doubles and triples all my appointments in my calendar making it hard to manage,0
good  the only thing it has that isnt on my samsung cal is agenda view crappy my scal has dark mode buscal  you can basically f off if youre vision impaired font size  dark mode are paid only not fun to test drive in the bright white light uninstall,0
better than google calendar but has bugsfor example it keeps restoring deleted events after i delete themi cleared cache memo and restarted phoneuselessstill the same banana updateyes i did remove gmail account but no useit seems a bug between localhost and oppo accounts as it shows both colors for the same birthdaybtw i tested removing oppo account or localhost then i get a bug free part of the calendar but it bugs again after that part updateyes 2 entries but for a certain period,0
wont refresh widget after android 90 update,0
niet te synchroniseren,0
permissions its all or its none wont operate attachments cant do it unless you go into a desktop pc browser on google calendar,0
i liked this app but stop deleting events i add on i cant keep readding events every hour im getting frustrated and will have to uninstall unless its corrected,0
didnt sync my google tasks,0
event notifications dont sound,0
3,0
paid for it 2 times keeps wanting me to pay for it again,0
great app when it works but dont assume you will get any support when it doesnt always read our help files and that is it,0
very pleased practical and clear upset that 1 i paid for and installed an upgrade on my phone but this did not happen on my tablet all i get is advert for upgrade but at extra cost 2 tasks is accessed in 3 steps why not 1,0
latest update broke google task can not synchronize try to log out and can not add google task again,0
i love this app  have used the pro version for years my only complaint is that i have a pt job that works in 24 h shifts 7a to 7a and theres no way to stop it from showing up on both days,1
برنامه باگ the bug is popping up all at once,1
ive been using this app since the business calendar v1 app i love that i can link to my google calendar and google to do items from the calendar,1
very helpful ,1
nice,1
good working app,1
i am a huge fan of fantastical on ios so i needed an app like it when i got an android phone i love the widget and i love the reminders feature my only critique is i wish there was a simpler view for the monthly view its a little overwhelming to see it all the way it is right now i like fantasticals monthly view better,1
perfect  has all the features that i need took out 1 star because i cant seem to add google meet video to my meetings,1
decent,1
very easy to use much better than googles calendar app in my opinion,1
great app so far,1
its pretty good aye,1
good but ads for over a minute,1
pretty good app,1
it will be perfect if could add a button to go back to today on widget,1
i like this app a lot but still having trouble syncing the app to my phone and my husbands phone,1
solid,1
this is a fantastic app i paid for the pro version after trying for a few weeks the features are just about right for me i switched from another paid app that ive been using for over 10 years 4 stars because 1 colors set manually for eventstasks do not carry across devices 2 minimum task synch time you can set is one hour,1
its really good would get 5th star if it was possible to refresh the widget at set intervals also manual refresh of the widget doesnt work have to open the app to sync,1
works well for me,1
keep it up,1
works very well easypracticalvery good game ads do pop upits ok,1
so far no issues with the app,1
this is am amazing ap id give it 5 stars but cant start week on a monday,1
good app but too much ads lately,1
great tool,1
very good,1
good experience,1
nice,1
great,1
its the best calendar,1
awesomeness,1
good calendar app,1
works reasonably well but has some integration issues with office 365 and outlook also not a big fan of the format but its definitely better than the builtin apps worth anything from microsoft,1
best calendar ive found more options for display and inserting content would make it perfect,1
very good,1
good program i do not like the fact that months scroll up and down this causes some confusion,1
please add delete option in notification,1
been using this for years i am still trying to figure out how to import my work google calendar,1
exceeeelllaaaannntt,1
works fine,1
great way to maintain appointments,1
adverts are very annoying and totally irrelevant for me,1
really cool but ui could be upgraded to look more sleek and its actually quite slow but maybe thats because of mh older phone model,1
easy to use,1
helpful and useful application it is a pity too much options are in the paid version,1
satisfied best app to use for multiple calendars i could easily control which calendar i would like to see especially during vacations office calendar stays hidden,1
great calendar would recommend,1
where can i turn off ampm time format here where i live 24 hours format is used and all that ampm stuff irritates too much i havent found this option in settings in previous versions was 24 hours format,1
keeps pushing me to rate the app even though i already have and gave you 5 stars loses a star,1
ive had this app for many years as it used to be the best its had some difficulties the past couple but they are improving again,1
great,1
needs a backup system,1
wish it woud sync better to audio all calenders that i have in google,1
very useful clearly laid out update in 2020 excellent app,1
sometimes doesnt synch over devices,1
great app with regular updates,1
integrates nicely with all calendars,1
much better calendar then the one that came with the phone,1
the best ever only bug when ur restart ur mobile,1
good,1
great app pulls together lots of info that keeps me intheknow and sane,1
i really like this calendar it syncs well with my google accounts  better than other 3rd party calendar apps ive tried ive only used the free version,1
nice app,1
 good,1
i like this app hope you habe this on ios,1
awesome,1
i would appreciate have notification alerts in my lock screen android 10 ,1
nice,1
great without the ads,1
ive been using this app for about 2 years i like the way you can customize so many aspects if you want but it is simple to use out of the box i use the widget almost exclusively,1
still enjoying this calendar app but would like it better if it was a little more intuitive ,1

still using this app every day some of the best with frequent updates kudos to the developers,1
good,1
much easier to read than google calendar,1
i like how it works though one massive thing i cant either figure out how to do which is more likely the case or you just dont have a repeat of the same event without having scheduled it 6 separate times in one day like eat 6 times a day supplements 8 times i think you get it other then that its perfect for work quick and easy for me to keep my clients in there own lane and me on time,1
good,1
good,1
my go to calendar,1
hi when will it be integrated with the dark mode setting on your phone,1
one or two interface aspects i might wish to adjust would like event status to be reflected in its display would like events to reflect their eventtype category,1
i like its efficiency leaves me with a sense of confidence that once entered will remind me when it should completely satisfied,1
great for keeping track of events and appointments,1
best i could find for my needs,1
i really like using buisness calendar whats missing for me is a windows version with an option to sync between phone and pc,1
great,1
i was using this app for years and im used to it but those ads are so annoying its sad for me to look for other options you should leave those ads out,1
very helpful and reliable,1

worst app,0
not working on my lenovo tab2 and its crash my tablet system old ver  work fine,0
you are required to give access to your calendar and contacts and other bs if i wanted to use google calendar i would use google calendar i want something not linked to any of my other accounts,0
very invasive into data collection,0
you cannot change the default online calendar this does me no good to only have multiple local calendars,0
got a new tablet which sync my notes fine after i uninstalled and signed back in my new phone wont sync on the app for my phone there is no place to sign out frustrating,0
not a fan i paid for the upgrade and it isnt working out for me maybe others will like it but i dont,0
doesnt look like the pictures at all exact same layout as your phones calendar now new settings etc waste of time app,0
i couldnt even make an account it wont work,0
i see no difference in this and google calendar,0
cannot get it to work on my huawei p20 i have tried 3 times and cannot get it to sign in it looks like it works fine on my ipad because i can sign up and get in but on my phone i am unable to do either i needed something that i could use on both devices but am unable to get into in ob my phone,0
i was really excited about this app but when i went to create an account it did not work i tried logging in with my google account but it still didnt work i am very disappointed,0
i cant get a refund and the app doesnt work google play is zero help and i cant reach a developer ive been robbed,0
lousy app,0
i loaded the app on to my amazon fire it will only display horizontally and i dont have the export option even though i have the premium subscription i cant export my task list either,0
would not let me create a log in,0
this app is not worth the 6 a year poorly developed with several glitches,0
1 star for obligatory signup using google fbtwitter,0
doesnt work offline requires internet and information so not personal as it is over the internet sorry did not get past first screen requiring sign up uninstalled,0
i couldnt even log in,0
cant sign in and there are reviews from october saying the same so no improvement over months of having the same issue,0
trash dont waste ur time unless u want to pay for the things that should b free,0
i dont care for the dashboard,0
couldnt even create a log in,0
piece of poo,0
note to self the demo version of this app is totally useless  so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs before paying for the premium version ill find another way to get my needs met im sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things since im not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles  i am passing this app over no thanks uninstalling,0
completed tasks continue to reappear,0
it wont allow you to create an account with email address and password why give you the option but then doesnt work when you use it if not resolved within a week uninstalling app,0
got a new phone and app now wont allow me to hit sign in button customer service is very slow to respond to help love the app for last 2  3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my  paid for it  to think it just renewed,0
why does this basic app need access to my contacts and refuse to work without give me a break you filthy parasites,0
closing and crashing when adding tasks and project support answering but doesnt help,0
not as advertised,0
too complicated when putting on data ill stay with my diary,0
the app does not work after last nights update,0
app has stopped opening,0
wouldnt let me make an regular account without linking something to it,0
well i just got it and attempted tocreate an account and after unfilled out the info it would not submit it what gives,0
the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app,0
took  before the renewal date have not recieved my refund and canceled on the due date,0
will not be using ever again,0
i cannot even create an account i fill in whats needed and im pressing the button and its not working some1 help,0
not great,0
this is a great planner but im really annoyed that having previously paid for the pro version i am now expected to pay an annual fee,0
annoyed paid for this years ago paid full version and used it and recommended it now i am asked to pay yearly to remove ads what joke i paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase,0
this app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen that is extremely suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling,0
i cant get new password it sends message email is not available,0
its simple enough to set up a task or eventbut not once has it reminded me as set to so looking for one that will,0
cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts dumb,0
cannot log in on other devices,0
i received a notice from planner pro this morning when i went to schedule some appts it notifies me i cannot use the app until payment received ii checked my bank and payment was made on 01262019 i will be cancelling as unable to use,0
wont even let me make a new account unusable,0
cant get account created tried linking facebook and straight account creation will not let me progress past sign in page,0
could not get the app to save event time properly all i wanted was to put a due date between 1150 pm and 1159 pm on a certain day would not do it the app kept automatically changing my times thats annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on,0
amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself,0
i hate it,0
i thought upgrading and paying the 8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app it does not i havent been able to sync any of my devices  absolutely will not let me add an event this was a waste of time and money if i cant add my schedule on my lap top version then theres no point to this app plus theres no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back ,0
uninstalled once i realized there are ads and it wipes your current google calendar,0
shows annoying full screen ads that pop up from time to time,0
want use only not sharing,0
this app deleted my whole google calender,0
dont bother with this planner app there are lots of other apps that do the same thing this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using seriously dont even bother with this bs,0
who puts ads on a calendar yall that desperate for money smh,0
does not integrate well across multiple crossplatform devices more upsetting to discover this after paying for the app,0
infested with ads now downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time i open it,0
app became unusable with 110618 update now the app takes 3045 to open up after i click it and then im get an annoying ad that plays that i cant close for another 510 seconds ill be finding a new calendar app,0
please fixed it why i cant login my passcode damnly alot of doc i ve save inside,0
cannot access the app,0
will not accept passcode after todays update have been a paid user for some time and need my info back please fix and i will update my review useless to me until resolved,0
no,0
it says you are downloading the pro version which is a complete lie,0
this basically is just a purple version of google calendar it has the almost exact same layout as google calendar without any extra features i wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with google dont bother getting this app just use calendar directly,0
absolutely terrible customer service they refused after several years to fix the 97 tablet aspect ratio for a paying customer this is absolutely poor customer service has never work properly once dont buy those that run away,0
could not even create a account,0
wants you to buy full version for tasks,0
you have to pay for reminders not worth it,0
absolute trash you cant do anything without paying 799 ,0
dates are wrong,0
it does not work as the ad,0
you shouldnt have to pay to get access for reoccurring events,0
theyve redone the layout and its horrible,0
will not sync calendars,0
i purchased the upgrade subscription and found no meaningful difference between the free application and the subscription application i feel ripped off and immediately ask for the return of my money,0
cant set a daily reminder without paying,0
it charges you 5 dollars for the same thing google provides,0
i have used this app for a while but two days ago it lost much of my data and now closes every time i try to use it  i tried to reboot the device but to no avail  i tried to contact support to no avail ,0
you shouldnt have to have an account,0
cant create account,0
not interested in any app that expects me to open an account before i can see anything associated within the app smh,0
it doesnt work at all,0
i set up a passcode and now it wont let me in can i bypass this if i cant i will be asking for a refund,0
not usable without purchasing,0
i chose the password route then they kicked me out my own account i hate google play services,0
i purchsed it in order to use projects and subtasks  disappointed to see its just tasks under projects and doesnt really have subtasis at all  how do i cancel my subscription,0
dont waist your money or time with this app,0
im not paying for it i dont care how good it is,0
looked good until i used it,0
why should i have to sign up for a calendar app and why does it need my contacts info i dont trust apps like this one there are plenty of great free apps that dont require sign up i am uninstalling i recommend time tune instead,0
used this app one day and it wouldnt accept my pin to get in i emailed support and never heard a word from them the app itself seemed decent but support is horrible,0
you cant even look at your schedule in the weekly view without paying their 5yr subscription trash,0
i downloaded this planner app for a secondary use it completely wiped out everything in my phone calendar which is primary,0
theres no point in downloading this app as it just repeats what any basic calendar app does,0
i hate the lay out its really confusing,0
requires access to my contacts not cool,0
logged out could not log back in tried a password reset got invalid email tried to recreate account got email already exists,0
i dont like this app because once you sign up you cant delete your account it sucks the support team wont respond to me and its been an hour now i would not recommend this app to anyone dont waste your time,0
wont  sync,0
since the last update the app wont load ive lost all my notes and homework for my class  please fix and i will change my review i usually love this app ,0
wont sync as promised did when i first loaded it but not now no good if it doesnt,0
how do i cancel the yearly subscription,0
free to download not free to schedule projects might as well write things down on notebook paper,0
butty,0
after paying the 5 i decided i didnt like it and canceled no refundsrip off,0
no reason to have to register before you can use it  dont like my info to spread online for privacy reasons so bc you make people register is why i uninstalled app,0
sucks within 1 minute ugh,0
this app is worthless if you dont buy full version i dont recommend downloading it,0
its a shame that you have a create a profile or give any of your social media account in order to log in,0
i cant do the setting thingy,0
it seems like it just a regular calander unless you pay for the full version,0
wont let me even test the features of the program without the hassle of creating a full account uninstalled,0
pathetic app the date does not change at 12am but it changes at 12pm and the developer doesnt even care to solve the issue worst app which doesnt even serve its purpose,0
to use this app fully the want you to pay there are many that dont so why waste money,0
cant do recurring tasks without paying for it the calendar my phone came with can do more then this one,0
sucks only does what calender does  dont need it,0
had this horrible app for about 3 minutes and deleted it,0
i like the interface a ton more than the google calendar and i would use it of it didnt have so many bugs with sharing calendars it worked briefly and then stopped by the end my events disappeared my settings were all right but it just didnt work for me i need a calendar that i can edit with my employer the help email couldnt help and stopped responding uninstalled too bad i already bought the computer app,0
i havent used this app or been charged in over a year now you guys charged me put my money back on the card now or i will report you to google,0
the fact that it forces landscape view is completely absurd,0
planner pro annual subscriber app has stopped working force closes on any action using widget,0
no at all free should be in payed app section,0
it is so dumb it starts off with the wrong month and you can do barley anything on it,0
with in 2 minutes the pascoe locked me out then didnt recognize my email not bothering to email since i didnt even get a chance to try it yet,0
it was terrible i couldnt even sign up it keeps glitching,0
this app changed the password i had and i dont know what it is what do i do,0
make it free,0
i lost all my records because these people quit supporting their app and are impossible to get ahold it does not sync like its supposed to so if you get a new device every record you ever put on this app is gone period,0
i would say this is nice but you need your email adress and i gave my correct one but it said please enter a valid email adress this is nice and i am not cursing but please remove the fact that we have to place our email adress i know this is not my app or game but im just giving a suggestion tq,0
used the pro version for a couple months as it seemed like a good app randomly deletes and duplicates events and unable to customise when events are recurring if they arent one day after another you have to manually enter them all uninstalled,0
they are always changing something after updates and it isnt always functional like used to be,0
the widget stops working way to much,0
nice looking app albeit does not seem to sync with google calendar and not cross platform certainly cannot do 15yr,0
this is literally just another calendar app misleading calling it a planner smh its not even a good calendar if youre hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it,0
its google calendar with different color scheme,0
loved this app until i updated updated it gibberish on every day now it is terrible like this on my phone and tablet how do i fix i depend on this planner,0
notifications stopped working then it deleted all my tasks,0
it used to be a good app until they added the latest update which includes ridiculously annoying ads and frequent crashes,0
please fix the widget it doesnt automatically update the day it always shows yesterdays date constantly having to remove and install widget,0
i think i could really like this app except i upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes it will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search,0
i was told to install planner pro instead of planner plus which was what i already used in order for my cell phone  ipad to sync i have had at least 5 emails back  forth with the contact person but i still cant get my calendars linked using my email address as instructed i guess i will have to go back to my google calendar i love the planner plus but need a calendar that syncs to both my cell and ipad,0
after reinstall data not recover while take backup google drive,0
i would love it if my calendar would sync across by devices and my tasks  notes synced its disappointing because i enjoy the simplicity of the format its user friendly but iy doesnt work for me since i cant sync all devices,0
pain ya have to create an account to access,0
it sucks,0
i set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes,0
i just installed this app and its always on landscape view please fix this soon thank you,0
its just a skin for google calendar,0
when my phone is in tablet mode android 7 the app will not display in portrait mode it defaults to landscape mode  pls fix and ill change my review,0
its ok the free version does the same thing your calender does on  your phone,0
would like questions answered i email my questions for answers  i give my contact info for almost two months now but no one contacts me this is very disappointing especially when i bought this app very poor for business kevin,0
i have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back they say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first i did email for answers but no one will answer my questions my questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people so this could be a great app but service is terrible which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping,0
didnt get past not being able to use it in portrait mode  i think i should be able to choose whether i need widespread view as in a spreadsheet or a portrait view to view a page of writing and this does not give me the option i may end up using it this is only the second app that i have tried for organizing by used to be hand  ink written notebooks,0
ads just too many,0
ui atrocious nothing fits,0
isnt thanksgiving and christmas considered a holiday am i wrong,0
this app is not good if you dont buy the subscription,0
the app worked fine for awhile but all the events i added were simply gone this morning this was a frustrating experience,0
i got locked out of my planner after entering my paascode the app said that the passcode was wrong it was not wrong i suspected a system glitch and contacted the developer on june 17th of this year i havent received any response yet i found my way around this problem by this time i will not renew my subscription anymore i will look for another app developer with a better customer service,0
why this  require this much personal details,0
i cant set my times for events bc theres no ampm option it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thingannoying,0
i paid for the pro version because the color coding in the free version didnt work properly come to find out that the pro version doesnt have daily tabs for tasks and notes as the free version does but the paid version does color code gaining that feature isnt worth losing the other two i feel robbed,0
it wouldnt let me in,0
i do not use it so i want to cancel the subscription but am unable jorte had unsubscribe within opening page unable to sign in,0
passcode feature is messed up and locked me out had to uninstall yr,0
it doesnt work well as a calander or any type of memo for me i also didnt like the type of layout design they made it didnt fit with what the purpose of this app was said to do,0
the app does not sync with my google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option meetings etc are not shown and i have to go back to the google calendar or acalender to make sure i dont miss anything events made on my tablet do not show on my phone please fix this its such a great app if it just worked,0
it would be a 5 review if it werent yearly payment put it a one time payment and ill be the first one to buy it this really ruined it for me,0
free app is crippled version of paid app costs 499 a year,0
if you want to start a project you have to pay 499 a year,0
unable to create an account despite using email or social media account cant even start trying out the app,0
this thing is terrible i couldnt do anything i wanted,0
you want me to pay 5 for the full version so i can set a task to repeat my phones planner does that for free,0
it has deleted all of my entries planned for today i am going to try a new app,0
task notifications have stopped working,0
its still asking me in an ad on the app to upgrade  not cool,0
wish i can repeat sirten things without spending  money every year,0
its okay,0
doesnt sync with google calendar the one thing its supposed to do and it failed,0
need full version for anything more than a calender,0
what happened to all those data i had not able to log also,0
have used app for about 4 months now i cant get back into it keeps asking to sign in or create account wont let me do either time to dump it,0
was a great appbut could not loginsince last month sobye bye planner pro,0
i put an event in and it doubles everyday fix the glitches this is a great app otherwise,0
at first i really liked it because all the systems are functioning well in my phone but when i used this in the tab the notifications wont even turn  i  sm really pissed by this and i hope you fix this asap,0
would not load,0
keeps telling me my email is invalid when its a normal gmail wont let me sign up,0
i went on thinking it was easy to put in reminders and stuff but it isntyou have to buy the full version,0
doesnt go to portrait,0
when opening this app on my tablet nexus 7 2013 my screen goes to landscape  upon exiting the app the screen remains stuck in landscape  only way to fix is to turn tablet off and back on,0
i love it,0
has potential but you gotta pay,0
paid for the pro version and itbdoesnt seem to be working properly  appointments are not showing and sometimes double books contacted support took several days to get back to me and was still not helpful app is glitchy will not be renewing the subscription and going back to the old pencil and paper appointment tracking method  i cannot run my business with a faulty appointment app very disappointing,0
5 for daily recurring tasks no thanks,0
it wouldnt sign me in at all and when i tryed to create an account it just stopped,0
im not going to create an account so uninstalled my tasks are private,0
i found this difficult to use due to navigation love the home screen but its impossible to get back to it also the nonstop full screen ad to buy the app yearly is so annoying that alone makes it unusable if you make my free experience terrible why would i want to pay you,0
wouldnt let me make reoccurring events without an upgrade,0
i liked the layout for the most part except being forced into landscape mode in the app the glitch was that when adding something to the calendar a box would come up for datetime but cut off the calendar and clock thats necessary to select datetime there was no way to even input manually it would work great if you only had to enter something for whichever date you were on and a specific one hour period set a half an hour after the time on your device very disappointing,0
this app wouldnt up date my schedule only some postings would transfer to my employees phones and i couldnt be positive something actually worked unless i checked to make sure twice i even bought the pro version not happy,0
i did like it until you updated and took the good features away lame,0
on the pictures it shows you things that are only on the paid version,0
i liked the version before the update where it had blocks to show the event thats the only reason why i downloaded it and now it got rid of it,0
changes and cancellations do not get updated on the widget secondly it is not possible to scroll between months  easily,0
it wasnt everything i thought it would be,0
i was happy with all the things with this app until i got up to find all my appointments were gone,0
the app always stops i had to restart my tab to make it work or try to open so many times,0
it was awesome the first week  now unless i upgrade and pay it locks up and constant request to pay for upgrade not free,0
dont like how it automatically syncs with gmail and calender,0
please can l use this for my boss appointment s,0
screenshots clearly show a weekly view but this isnt available unless you buy the full version for 349,0
there are lots better calendartask tracking apps out there  calengoo to name just one,0
would be great but this app has 31 days in february this year it throws off everything for the rest of the year,0
task sync with google calendar not working,0
pop up reminder not showing for scheduled events,0
i like to look at this at the start but then it wouldnt even show the correct date when you open up in the morning,0
no way to jump ahead in month view  if you need to enter an event thats two months out its a pain to do  i uninstalled it,0
i would like to tap on the times i want to do something as oppose to going through the new event button,0
it only notifies you once or twice then it doesnt notify you again,0
on some point stopped showing calendar items waste of time,0
guess it doesnt sync tasks from google calendar,0
ive just downloaded this and i cant figure out how to set the same tasks to reaccre every day without having to type it in over and over  is there a way to do this if so can someone help me plz,0
idk it is kk,0
when i put any task in a certain day it says that planner stopped and not working,0
didnt work well on my devise probably because its an android,0
no reminders notifications,0
bought full version then got a refund  it wont sync,0
i felt really disappointed to find it did not look as shown the week view is only available in the paid version,0
need to pay for such feature  else should be perfect for a planner usage,0
it looked decent app but uses cpu too much makes phone run hot even with android 511,0
basic,0
keeps crashing every time i try to use it,0
good app need to be able to synch with google calendar,0
everytime i try to open an event it stops and closes out,0
cant sync with google calendar,0
this app looked good until i had to purchase it just to get the week view now everytime i choose week view it crashes and stops working i want a refund or a fix,0
its ok,0
i would have rwnewed my annual subscriptuon if they had provided sync with windows laptop,0
can be better for self organising,0
ok,0
its a great app but i wish you guys would arrange tasks based on their set time instead of be prioritizing them,0
use to track work things,0
really like the app however it is multiplying my tasks on a daily basis and i cant delete them as fast as they appear frustraring not using it right now,0
good app however the notification has stopped working,0
g o o d,0
its actually good but it doesnt have a feature where your task appears on your lockscreen that will remind you everytime you forgot something to do,0
does not update tasks in widget automatically,0
bought the planner pro love the app the down side is that the app did not sync i have 2 device handphone and tablet both android i have to update both device twice instead of once would give 4 or 5 star if it can sync between both device i have some suggestion maybe can input some bill tracker and some cute icon or pill tracker hydration icon,0
landscape mode only big problem cant make it portrait on my kindle fire 8,0
why wont my homescreen widget display all day events this makes it really difficult to use,0
like the concept but tech support cannot get rid of ads and popups tried over several months but they are gone a short while then return the response lag and language issues are frustrating this changed my review and i removed the app,0
i like this app but the ads are getting aggravating especially the trump ads id prefer not to see him on my phone thank you very much,0
it works it just hard,0
good,0
its a nice app it make my life displined,0
nyc,0
wont do recurring tasks does not connect to gtasks as shown in the cover photo hasnt been updated in a long time,0
it is ok,0
cant wait to try it,0
loved it except that it wouldnt save and show me all of my events,0
just downloaded this appnot sure what i think of it at the momentcant seem to find where you can use colours like the pictures,0
it says i changed my password and now cant get in calendar what can i do to fix problems,0
so so i expected the ability to attach files to notes and a lot more flexibility with format,0
the event didnt sync to my other device,0
good,0
this app is easy to use but my biggest issue is that when i add notes or check off tasks when off line they dont save,0
helpful but not too much,0
i liked the app well enough to pay for it so i could get my recurring items in order with it but when i set a task as recurring it only shows up on the day that i started with,0
great ,0
it worked great to start with but now im not getting task notifications and some of my events are not showing up on my calendar widget,0
it does not have the ending time of an event,0
how can i take the notes i have made and copy them over to my laptop i have looked to see where the notes save to but cant seem to find them anywhere please help me,0
good app that i can use for putting all my appointments in one problem is that the notifications i set to make sure it reminds me dont go off at all i have a droid turbo 2 if you guys could fix that i will change to 5 stars,0
a good app overall but the new version no longer shows the duration of events which is extremely annoying and a deal breaker for me,0
the app no longer notifies me of my tasks please fix,0
it doesnt work well for repeated scheduling of regular tasks  i have tried selecting every week or every 7 days and repeat either does not work at all or shows up only for the same day monthly not weekly,0
i love it so far but is it usable over multiple devices i am currently using it on my tablet and downloaded the app to my phone but when i try to sign in it says it cant find my email address,0
try,0
its ok,0
not being able to view my list of things to do or to get,0
the app is making me sign in to an account but wont  let me sign in frustrated,0
the reviews are sending a clear message to you act on them i think the last update has messed everyone up if you dont actyoure sending a message backie you meant to mess everyone up by locking them out,0
this planner app is pretty clear and simple i have the paid version and it works ok except today they had a glitch and i lost everything even when i reinstalled it was just so screwed up  so if you dont mind losing all of your work when they update i guess its survivable,0
add ability to have a dark theme,0
troublesome widget organization when i tap a date it opens app to date previously open not new date needed very time consuming and creates booking mistakes when not careful,0
enjoyed its use while it lasted uninstalled now,0
cant make calls from the app by clicking on the phone number like google calendar,0
crashing a lot after update,0
уууу,0
fix the widget bugs please,0
its alright,0
overall good a search feature would be great for notes thanks,0
have to go premium to have more features,0
it was ok,0
i love it but too expensive,0
the only thing not working is the reminder im using huawei mate8 can somebody help me how,0
i use it mainly for its widgets one thing though please fix the widgets so that the they show the current date and dont stay put on the previous day unless manually changed,0
just getting used to it but so far not bad,0
it doesnt update between your calanders i need a planner that stays up to date with my calendar changes this is not it  waste of money,0
why would i pay money to have recurring events in a planner i think ill stick with my default calander app,0
nice,0
good integration with other calanders but not easy to read at a glance,0
dont have option for windows surface pro,0
font is too small  you have to open it up each time you want to glance at your appointments,0
hodtf coder jbikhkhkm kvukb,0
nice app,0
sometimes quits as it starts,0
needs more features but i just started using it so ill let u know specifics soon,0
not bad,0
i bought the allegedly better version it worked for about a month i had all my scheduled stuff about 6 months and all of a sudden the disappeared which sucks,0
i really liked it at first but it keeps turning on the alarm for my events even though i pressed no alarm i dont know how many times ,0
simple  feel like paper planner,1
helpful with notes and events no restrictions to enter everything like appointments,1
so far i like it very much i use it daily and it helps me stay organized and focused,1
very efficient love it,1
works pretty good for what i need it for i was looking for a franklin day planner look but this comes up on the day i put the reminder on in my calendar so it is helpful its working for me as a partial retired person,1
its ok i have this app for several years i dont like the advertisements,1
i love this app a couple of suggestions 1 for the repeat function i wish it had more flexibility such as an end date since i am a visual person i would love it if the task list had color associated with the level of importance but i do love this app so much that i upgraded,1
happy with it,1
i like the app but the user interface could be polished the seems slightly delayed a new look would be nice but over all a helpful app would still recommend,1
good so far,1
great app really needs a desktop capability,1
does it work in a laptop on the web,1
so far so good,1
so far works great,1
love it,1
this is a decent app for keeping track events and appointments,1
nice,1
any chance of getting a widget for the calendar love the dark mode,1
would be nice to have the ability to add more tabs,1
good app to use ive been bullet journaling by hand but moving back to digital and this was the best i found to transition early days but so far so good,1
good help,1
good planner apps,1
very good reminder,1
i would subscribe in the app if it supports righttoleft languages such as arabic when i switch my mobile to arabic the text in the widgets mix up with buttons,1
i have been using this app for years what l especially like is the simplicity of use,1
easy to use app allows me to keep track of my busy schedule,1
i like the app i use the weekly planner widget thw most so it is easier to get organized it syncs with google calendar the only reason i am not giving it a 5 stars is becauae after an update it stopped updating the week on my screen and i have to search for the right week everytime,1
easy to navigate,1
good interface but recent tech issues app slow to open,1
just using basic to track milage works fine,1
i love that the app interface is so easy to use the reason i dont give it 5 stars is because you cant export notes it would be ideal if that could be done,1
great app i would rate it a 5 but theres an error where my completed tasks becomes unchecked constantly causing it to keep on becoming an unfinished task and its annoying,1
good,1
great app,1
osm osm osm osm,1
great app and the only flaw i see is that you cant yet export your data please make it so you can export data to something like pdf or something so i can save my entries forever,1
so far the best planner app i ever come across room for improvement ie to be accessible on pc as if some other app does,1
it is what i have looked for for some time i wish it could syncd across multiple devices,1
i wish i could create notes without having to select a date otherwise so far so nice ,1
better to have a search option for notes,1
very easy to use have all i need,1
it takes time burpt good but it keeps getting out like you cant login,1
great,1
just installed and am liking it so far i do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar also sub tasks would be very useful with those changes i might actually be able to downsize the apps i use,1
i just need notification  tone more than these and much more long,1
seems like there is a bug when trying to sync my notes to my dropbox account would give you 5 stars if fixed,1
havent found how to sync between two devices yet,1
good job,1
awesome,1
great user interface easy to use syncing with google calendar is a huge advantage from todo lists to events you can schedule anything,1
i love this app  i have always been a franklin covey planner gal and this is similar to the paper planner  great search function,1
great tool,1
its pretty good,1
nice apps but need to re download the full version,1
overall a good app but i would also like the option of switching from landscape view,1
add alarms to notification in events or tasks and allow to add ringtone on it love it,1
a great app i just downloaded it and i already love it the only issue here is slight ui bugs november 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout again great app but those errors make the app look less professional i would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar definitely am recommending to friends though,1
good enaught,1
ok,1
the perfect planneronly thing missing is that remimder is not working,1
this app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as its annoying the app will opened up when i pressed the box to tick what ive completed everytime,1
i think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg,1
i would like to be able to import my contacts to it i would give 5 stars for that,1
the essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection its about progress this application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments senior project engineer here it really helps alot thank you,1
i like it,1
its cool,1
i just downloaded this  the free version was definitely useful but i went ahead and got the paid version because i wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well  i definitely think this will be worth the purchase,1
i really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading if i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee give me a break 5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year yall are greedy,1
this is a great planner app only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees,1
the app was working fine until i removed google now now the widgets will not show on home page,1
planned not bad,1
greatly improved comment from me  much better than a year ago  most updated lead to improvement  wish the  want an annual subscription,1
its ,1
almost all the functionality of the franklin planner this is a great app,1
the calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful,1
its a really great app,1
if only the calender icons cld stop piling up on the phobe task bar everytime one is due so if i created 5 events to go off in an hr ill have 5 icons piled up on my fone its not needed or at least put an option so people cld disable it if they dont want it,1
cool,1
this planner pro is very nice and better for you time schedule,1
awesome app wish had auto sort feature of priority task like franklin planner use to have,1
works great most of the time however crashes when making my display size small google pixel recurring error,1
nice app but can update a function such as we can add in an attachmentlike photo into the task or etc will be better,1
i loved this app worked so great i purchased it now it has logged me out and says i dont exist,1
i dont know it works good and i like that you can add notes to the task that is very helpful i just kind of would like to have a better weekly view but all in all it gets the job done,1
like it a little even bought the pro version but when i went to the website trying to find out how do you back up your data in the event something happens to your phone,1
great app and easy to use would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect that arent just for the day,1
it is helpful,1
however there are a few bugs every so often one of my recurring tasks will appear twice on one day and i have to delete it the synchronization with drop box isnt good enough to use on two devices i would be useful if you could choose third sunday of every month for recurring tasks,1
good for studying,1
havent been using this app for long but it seems great so far i love that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day i just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes that would make this a 5star review,1
would love to be able to customize the app more  need to add a dark theme and also add an agenda view,1
i liked it but is there a widget for the app,1
gud for organised businessman,1
app,1
thanks,1
good features n easy to use,1
plan daily schedule,1
this is what i have been finding ,1
why on earth when im on one day and create a task it schedules it for the day before that by default just why,1
this is one of my favorite apps,1
amazing,1
nettymac,1
it was very useful for me to plan my days until the latest update which the widget shows the wrong day and i am unable switch the day,1
this application is very useful in helping keep me organized and paced the only suggestion id make is on the interface when checking off my tasks for the day the add new task button is in the way of pressing the cross off button its a bit annoying but i love this app,1
love it,1
user friendly and plenty of bells and whistles  ,1
app shuts down somtimes,1
can you add time in notes also like events,1
easy to use,1
its really good,1
only thing i dont like is that when creating a recurring event the date doesnt show on the monthly view until you scroll over to the actual week of the event it would be a lot better if i could see those dates on the monthly view without having to scroll fix please for 5 star rating,1
extremely easy to use and exactly what i was looking for love the widget for this planner as well i just wish the interface was a bit more aesthetically pleasing like a bit more sleekmodern,1
easy,1
i like it,1
5 stars if it were completely free ,1
thanks for calander maker to hv realised that notes are necessary with task and calander then also necessary to hv online backup of those what hv been done not only the calander syncits already well synced,1
quite helpfulhelps me reach my daily targets,1
i like it works well if you are use to the franklin time management system,1
useful apps,1
very useful,1
i paid for this application on my ipad now i am asked to pay for it on my android to get the same features why do i have to pay twice for the same app i hope the developers respond to me,1
i loved the app but had to delete it because i couldnt choose which calendars i wanted to sync,1
will be 5 stars if it can be backed up via cloud,1
easy to use  i like being able to add sub tasks and notes  still new to using it though,1
amazing,1
very practical but a bit sluggish,1
it connects to your phone calendar so its very useful for having more space to put notes and tasks,1
nice,1
it is a nice and handy app to manage ur work,1
up to now it pretty much feeds my necesities,1
great planner for me,1

i like more the design and how the calendar features are displayed on a same screen,1
i search diligently for an help to help me structure my time with the hope that it would improve my productivity i found it with this planner it really helps me to manage my time and stay focus on the assigned tasks or events,1
